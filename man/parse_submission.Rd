\title{Parse Submission}
\usage{
parse_submission(uri)
}
\arguments{
\item{uri}{- URL to a SEC complete submission text file}
}
\value{
a dataframe with one row per document.
}
\description{
Raw SEC filings are sent in a SGML file - this parses that master submission
into component documents, with content lines in list column 'TEXT'.
}
\details{
Most of the time the information you need along with the specific files
will be available by using \code{\link{filing_documents}}, but there are
scenarios where you may want to access the full contents of the master
submission -
  \describe{
    \item{Old Submissions}{Older submissions are not parsed into component
          documents by the SEC so access requires parsing the main filing}
    \item{Full Document List}{The SEC only provides what it considers the
          relevant documents, but filings often include many more ancillary
          files}
    \item{Efficient Downloading}{If you're fetching many documents from a
          filing over many filings, there can be efficiency gains from just
          downloading a single file.}
  }

*NOTE:* non-text documents are uuencoded and need a separate decoder to be
viewed.
