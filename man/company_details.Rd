}
\arguments{
\item{x}{either a stock ticker, CIK number, or XML document for a company page}

\item{ownership}{boolean for inclusion of company change filings}

\item{type}{Type of filing to fetch. NOTE: due to the way the SEC EDGAR system
works, it is actually is a 'starts-with' search, so for instance specifying
'type = "10-K" will return "10-K/A" and "10-K405" filings as well. To ensure
you only get the type you want, best practice would be to filter the results.}

\item{before}{yyyymmdd format of latest filing to fetch}

\item{count}{Number of filings to fetch per page. Valid options are 10, 20, 40,
80, or 100. Other values will result in the closest count.}
