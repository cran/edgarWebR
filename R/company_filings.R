#' SEC Company Filings
#'
#' @param x either a stock ticker, CIK number, or XML document for a company page
#' @param ownership boolean for inclusion of company change filings
#' @param type Type of filing to fetch. NOTE: due to the way the SEC EDGAR system 
#'     works, it is actually is a 'starts-with' search, so for instance specifying
#'     'type = "10-K" will return "10-K/A" and "10-K405" filings as well. To ensure
#'     you only get the type you want, best practice would be to filter the results.
#' @param before yyyymmdd format of latest filing to fetch
#' @param count Number of filings to fetch per page. Valid options are 10, 20, 40,
#'     80, or 100. Other values will result in the closest count.
#' @param page Which page of results to return.
#'
#' @return A dataframe of company filings
#' @examples
#' company_filings("AAPL")
