[ ]\n\nAs of February 26, 2002, Ford had outstanding 1,735,756,535 shares of Common\nStock and 70,852,076 shares of Class B Stock. Based on the New York Stock\nExchange Composite Transaction closing price of the Common Stock on that date\n($15.55 a share), the aggregate market value of such Common Stock was\n$26,991,014,119. Although there is no quoted market for our Class B Stock,\nshares of Class B Stock may be converted at any time into an equal number of\nshares of Common Stock for the purpose of effecting the sale or other\ndisposition of such shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock and Class\nB Stock outstanding at February 26, 2001 included shares owned by persons who\nmay be deemed to be \"affiliates\" of Ford. We do not believe, however, that any\nsuch person should be considered to be an affiliate.

Business\n-----------------\n\n         Ford Motor Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1919. We acquired\nthe business of a Michigan company, also known as Ford Motor Company,\nincorporated in 1903 to produce and sell automobiles designed and engineered by\nHenry Ford. We are the world's second-largest producer of cars and trucks\ncombined. We and our subsidiaries also engage in other businesses, including\nfinancing and renting vehicles and equipment.\n\n\n                                    Overview\n\n         Our business is divided into two business sectors: the Automotive\nsector and the Financial Services sector. We manage these sectors as three\nprimary operating segments as described below.\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n\n\nBusiness Sectors       Operating Segments           Description\n----------------       ------------------           -----------\n<s>                    <c>                          <c>\nAutomotive:\n                       Automotive                   design, manufacture, sale, and service\n                                                    of cars and trucks\n\nFinancial Services:\n                       Ford Motor Credit Company    vehicle-related financing, leasing, and\n                                                    insurance\n\n                       The Hertz Corporation        renting and leasing of cars and trucks and\n                                                    renting industrial and construction\n                                                    equipment, and other activities\n</TABLE>\n\n     We provide financial  information (such as, revenues,  income,  and assets)\nfor each of these business sectors and operating segments in three areas of this\nReport:  (1) Item 6. \"Selected  Financial Data\" on pages 36 through 38; (2) Item\n7. \"Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of\nOperations\"  on  pages  39  through  57;  and (3)  Note 18 of the  Notes  to our\nConsolidated  Financial  Statements  located  at the  end of this  Report  (page\nFS-21).  Financial  information  relating  to certain  geographic  areas is also\nincluded in the above-mentioned areas of this Report.\n\n\nRevitalization Plan\n-------------------\n\n     Following an extensive  review of our North and South American  operations,\non January 11, 2002,  we announced a  revitalization  plan (the  \"Revitalization\nPlan\") that includes the following elements:\n\n     o    New products: A product-led revitalization program that will result in\n          the introduction of 20 new or freshened  products in the United States\n          annually between now and mid-decade.\n\n     o    Plant  capacity:  Reduction  of  North  American  plant  manufacturing\n          operating  capacity by about one million  vehicles  by  mid-decade  to\n          realign capacity with market conditions.\n\n     o    Hourly  workforce:  About 12,000 hourly employees in North America are\n          affected  by  actions  completed  in  December  2001  or to  be  taken\n          throughout 2002 and beyond.  An additional 3,000 hourly employees were\n          affected  in 2001.  Plans are being  made to  reassign  as many  plant\n          employees as possible.\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\n\n     o    Salaried workforce: Our 2001 voluntary separation program for salaried\n          employees  and  other  related  actions  resulted  in  a  3,500-person\n          workforce reduction in North America. This program will be extended to\n          achieve an additional  1,500-person  salaried  workforce  reduction to\n          reach  the  goal  of  5,000.  If  necessary  to  meet  this  goal,  an\n          involuntary separation program will be used.\n\n     o    Global  workforce:  More than  35,000  employees  will be  affected by\n          combined actions around the world by mid-decade. These include: 21,500\n          in North  America - 15,000  hourly,  5,000  salaried  and 1,500 agency\n          employees - and 13,500 in the rest of the world.\n\n     o    Material costs: A material  cost-reduction  program has been initiated\n          with North American  suppliers which shares design savings,  with Ford\n          receiving 65 percent of  implemented  cost  reductions  and  suppliers\n          receiving 35 percent in the first year. Designs will be developed that\n          will help  improve our  products and overall  quality.  This  program,\n          along with other  material  cost  reduction  efforts,  is  expected to\n          improve   ongoing  annual  profits  before  taxes  by  $3  billion  by\n          mid-decade.\n\n     o    Discontinued  low-margin models: The Mercury Cougar, Mercury Villager,\n          Lincoln Continental and Ford Escort will be discontinued this year.\n\n     o    Beyond North  America:  Revitalization  plans  beyond  North  American\n          automotive  operations  include the  continued  implementation  of the\n          European   transformation   strategy,  the  Premier  Automotive  Group\n          strategy,  the turnaround in South America and a revised direction for\n          Ford Motor Credit Company.\n\n     o    Divestitures:  We  are  pursuing  the  sale  of  non-core  assets  and\n          businesses.  Our plan  includes  $1 billion of cash  realization  from\n          these actions in 2002.\n\n\n     Manufacturing  plans over the next several years  include:  1) closing five\nplants:  Edison  Assembly,  Ontario Truck Plant,  St. Louis Assembly,  Cleveland\nAluminum  Casting and Vulcan Forge;  2) no new products have been identified for\ntwo plants:  Ohio  Assembly  and  Cuautitlan  Assembly;  3) pursuing the sale of\nWoodhaven  Forging Plant;  4) major  downsizing  and shift  reductions at eleven\nplants;  and 5) line speed reductions and changes to operating  patterns at nine\nplants.\n\n\n                                Automotive Sector\n\n     We  sell  cars  and  trucks   throughout  the  world.   In  2001,  we  sold\napproximately 7 million vehicles  throughout the world.  Our automotive  vehicle\nbrands include Ford, Mercury,  Lincoln,  Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin\nand TH!NK.  Substantially all of our cars, trucks and parts are marketed through\nretail dealers in North America, and through distributors and dealers outside of\nNorth  America.  At December 31,  2001,  the  approximate  number of dealers and\ndistributors  worldwide  distributing  our vehicle brands was as follows:  Ford,\nover 13,000;  Mercury,  2,229;  Lincoln,  1,610; Volvo, 2,500; Jaguar, 694; Land\nRover,  2,300; Aston Martin, 81; TH!NK, 69. Because many dealerships  distribute\nmore than one of our brands from the same sales  location,  a single  dealership\nmay be counted under more than one brand in the previous sentence.\n\n     The worldwide automotive industry, Ford included, is affected significantly\nby a number of factors  over which we have  little  control,  including  general\neconomic  conditions.  In  the  United  States,  the  automotive  industry  is a\nhighly-competitive,  cyclical  business  that  has a  wide  variety  of  product\nofferings.  The  number  of cars and  trucks  sold to  retail  buyers  (commonly\nreferred to as \"industry  demand\") can vary  substantially from year to year. In\nany year,  industry demand depends largely on general economic  conditions,  the\ncost of purchasing and operating cars and trucks,  and the availability and cost\nof credit and fuel.  Industry demand also reflects the fact that cars and trucks\nare durable items that people generally can wait to replace.\n\n                                       2\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\n\n     The  worldwide  automotive  industry  consists of many  producers,  with no\nsingle dominant producer. Certain manufacturers,  however, account for the major\npercentage  of  total  sales  within  particular  countries,   especially  their\ncountries  of  origin.  Most  of the  factors  that  affect  the  United  States\nautomotive industry and its sales volumes and profitability are equally relevant\noutside the United States.\n\n     The  worldwide  automotive  industry  also is affected  significantly  by a\nsubstantial amount of costly governmental  regulation.  In the United States and\nEurope, for example, governmental regulation has arisen primarily out of concern\nfor the environment,  for greater vehicle safety, and for improved fuel economy.\nMany governments  also regulate local content and/or impose import  requirements\nas a means of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, or influencing their\nbalance of payments.\n\n     Our unit sales vary with the level of total  industry  demand and our share\nof that industry  demand.  Our share is  influenced by how our products  compare\nwith  those  offered by other  manufacturers  based on many  factors,  including\nprice, quality, styling, reliability,  safety, and functionality. Our share also\nis affected by our timing of new model introductions and manufacturing  capacity\nlimitations.  Our ability to satisfy changing consumer  preferences with respect\nto type or size of vehicle and its design and  performance  characteristics  can\nimpact our sales and earnings significantly.\n\n     The  profitability of vehicle sales is affected by many factors,  including\nthe following:\n\n     o    unit sales volume\n     o    the mix of vehicles and options sold\n     o    the margin of profit on each vehicle sold\n     o    the level of \"incentives\" (price discounts) and other marketing costs\n     o    the costs for customer warranty claims and other customer satisfaction\n          actions\n     o    the costs for  government-mandated  safety,  emission and fuel economy\n          technology and equipment\n     o    the ability to manage  costs\n     o    the ability to recover cost increases through higher prices\n\nFurther,  because Ford and other  manufacturers  have a high proportion of costs\nthat are fixed  (including  relatively  fixed  labor  costs),  relatively  small\nchanges in unit sales volumes can  dramatically  affect  overall  profitability.\nTherefore, should industry demand soften because of slowing or negative economic\ngrowth in the major  markets in which we  operate,  or should our share of total\nindustry sales decline, our profitability will be adversely affected.  In recent\nyears,  industry  sales of  vehicles  in the United  States  have been at record\nlevels (17.5, 17.8 and 17.4 million units in 2001, 2000 and 1999  respectively).\nIn 2002,  however,  we expect  industry sales volumes in the United States to be\nabout  16.5  million  units  and we expect  to incur  significant  losses in our\nAutomotive segment in 2002.\n\n     Following  is a  discussion  of the  automotive  industry in the  principal\nmarkets where we compete,  as well as a discussion of our Ford Customer  Service\nDivision:\n\nUnited States\n-------------\n\n     Sales  Data.

truck businesses in North America and Australia/New\nZealand to Freightliner  Corporation.  Ford ceased production of heavy trucks in\nNorth  America  in  December  1997.  The  transfer  of the  North  American  and\nAustralian heavy truck businesses was completed in 1998.\n\n     As shown in the tables  above,  since 1997 there has been a shift from cars\nto trucks for both industry sales and Ford sales. Ford's sales of the middle car\nsegment  as a  percentage  of its  total  sales has  deteriorated  more than the\ngeneral   decline  of  the  industry  sales  in  that  segment  because  of  the\ndiscontinuance   of  certain  product  offerings  in  the  segment  (e.g.,  Ford\nThunderbird  and Contour and Mercury  Mystique) and, more recently,  lower fleet\nsales of the Ford Taurus model.\n</TABLE>\n\n                                       4\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1.

Business (Continued)\n\n\n     Marketing  Incentives and Fleet Sales.  Automotive  manufacturers that sell\n     -------------------------------------\nvehicles in the United States typically give purchasers price discounts or other\nmarketing  incentives.  These  incentives are the result of competition from new\nproduct offerings by manufacturers and the desire to maintain  production levels\nand market  shares.  Manufacturers  provide these  incentives to both retail and\nfleet customers  (fleet  customers  include daily rental  companies,  commercial\nfleet  customers,  leasing  companies  and  governments).  Marketing  incentives\ngenerally are higher during periods of economic downturns,  when excess capacity\nin the industry tends to increase. We estimate that there exists presently about\nfive to six million units of excess capacity in North America.\n\n     Our marketing costs for the Ford,  Lincoln and Mercury brands in the United\nStates as a percent of gross sales  revenue for those brands were as follows for\nthe three years indicated:  14.7% (2001), 11.1% (2000), and 10.6% (1999). In the\nfourth quarter of 2001, our United States  marketing costs as a percent of gross\nsales  revenue  for those  brands was 16.7%.  These  \"marketing  costs\"  include\nprimarily (i) marketing incentives on vehicles, such as retail rebates and costs\nfor special financing and lease programs,  (ii) reserves for costs and/or losses\nassociated with our required repurchase of certain vehicles sold to daily rental\ncompanies,  and (iii) costs for advertising  and sales  promotions for vehicles.\nThe  increase  in  marketing  costs over the last  several  years is a result of\nintense competition in the United States market.\n\n     Fleet sales generally are less  profitable than retail sales,  and sales to\ndaily rental  companies  generally are less profitable than sales to other fleet\npurchasers.  The mix between  sales to daily  rental  companies  and other fleet\ncustomers has been about evenly split in recent years. The table below shows our\nfleet sales in the United States,  and the amount of those sales as a percentage\nof our total United States car and truck sales, for the last five years.\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                                                Ford Fleet Sales\n                                                        ------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                Years Ended December 31,\n                                                        ------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          2001          2000          1999          1998          1997\n                                                        ---------     ---------     ----------    ---------     ----------\n<s>                                                     <c>            <c>           <c>           <c>           <c>\nUnits sold.........................................      885,000       977,000       940,000       878,000       923,000\nPercent of Ford's total U.S. car and truck sales...        22%           23%           23%           22%           24%\n</TABLE>\n\n     Warranty  Coverage.  We presently  provide warranty coverage for defects in\n     ------------------\nfactory-supplied  materials and  workmanship on all vehicles  (other than medium\ntrucks) in the United States.  This warranty coverage for Ford/Mercury  vehicles\nextends  for 36 months or 36,000  miles  (whichever  occurs  first)  and  covers\ncomponents of the vehicle,  including tires  beginning  January 1, 2001 for 2001\nand later model years.  Prior to January 1, 2001,  tires were  warranted only by\nthe tire  manufacturers.  The United States warranty coverage for 2002 and later\nmodel years TH!NK Neighbor  vehicles extends for 36 months with unlimited miles.\nThe United States warranty coverage for luxury vehicles (Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo,\nand Land Rover) extends for 48 months or 50,000 miles  (whichever  occurs first)\nbut, except for Lincoln beginning January 1, 2001, does not include tires, which\nare warranted by the tire manufacturers. In general, different warranty coverage\nis provided on medium  trucks and on vehicles  sold  outside the United  States.\nWarranty  coverage for safety  restraint  systems  (safety  belts,  air bags and\nrelated  components)  extends for 60 months or 50,000  miles  (whichever  occurs\nfirst) and 60 months with  unlimited  miles for 2002 and later model years TH!NK\nNeighbor vehicles.  Also,  corrosion damage resulting in perforation  (holes) in\nbody  sheet  metal  panels is  covered  on 1995 and newer  models  for 60 months\n(unlimited  mileage).  In addition,  the Federal Clean Air Act requires warranty\ncoverage  for 8 years or 80,000 miles  (whichever  occurs  first) for  emissions\nequipment (catalytic converter and powertrain control module) on most light duty\nvehicles  sold in the United  States.  As a result of these  warranties  and the\nconcern  for  customer  satisfaction,  costs  for  warranty  repairs,  emissions\nequipment repairs,  and customer  satisfaction actions (\"warranty costs\") can be\nsubstantial. Estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at\nthe time of sale. Such accruals, however, are subject to adjustment from time to\ntime depending on actual experience.\n\n                                       6\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\n\nEurope\n------\n\n     Market  Share  Information.  Outside  of the United  States,  Europe is our\n     ---------------------------\nlargest  market for the sale of cars and  trucks.  The  automotive  industry  in\nEurope is intensely competitive. Over the past year, we estimate that 145 new or\nfreshened vehicles,  including derivatives of existing vehicles, were introduced\nin the European market by various manufacturers.  For the past 10 years, the top\nsix  manufacturers  have  collectively held between 73% and 77% of the total car\nmarket,  and have each achieved a car market share in about the 9% to 19% range.\n(Manufacturers' shares, however, vary considerably by country.) This competitive\nenvironment is expected to intensify further as Japanese  manufacturers increase\ntheir production capacity, and all of the manufacturers of premium brands (e.g.,\nBMW,  Mercedes Benz and Audi)  continue to broaden their product  offerings.  We\nestimate that in 2001 the European  automotive  industry had excess  capacity of\napproximately  six million  units  (based on a comparison  of European  domestic\ndemand and capacity).\n\n     In 2001,  vehicle  manufacturers  sold  approximately 17.8 million cars and\ntrucks in Europe,  about the same as 2000  levels.  Our  combined  car and truck\nmarket share in Europe in 2001 was 10.7%,  up 7/10 of one percentage  point from\n2000.\n\n     Britain and Germany are our most important markets within Europe,  although\nthe Southern  European  countries  are becoming  increasingly  significant.  Any\nadverse  change in the British or German market has a significant  effect on our\ntotal European automotive  profits.  For 2001 compared with 2000, total industry\nsales were up 10% in Britain and down 2% in Germany.\n\n     For  purposes  of the figures  shown in this  section,  we have  considered\nEurope to consist of the following 19 markets:  Britain, Germany, France, Italy,\nSpain, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands,  Portugal, Switzerland,  Finland,\nSweden, Denmark, Norway, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, and Poland.\n\n     Motor  Vehicle  Distribution  in Europe. On February 5, 2002,  the European\n     ---------------------------------------\nCommission  proposed a new  regulation  that would change the way motor vehicles\nare sold and  repaired  throughout  the  European  Community.  While  Ford could\ncontinue to maintain its \"exclusive\" distribution  arrangements that allow it to\nprovide dealers with exclusive sales territories,  the new rules would eliminate\nthe  presently  allowable  restrictions  on resale.  This means that our dealers\ncould sell vehicles to any reseller (e.g., supermarket chains, internet agencies\nand  other  resellers  not  authorized  by us)  who in  turn  could  sell to end\ncustomers  both within and outside of the dealer's  exclusive  sales  territory.\nAlternatively,  manufacturers could establish a \"selective\"  distribution regime\nthat would allow the  manufacturer  to determine the number but not the location\nof its  dealers.  Dealers  also  would  be free to set up  additional  sales  or\ndelivery  outlets  within the  European  Union and provide  active  sales to all\ncustomers  within the European  Union,  but not sell motor vehicles to resellers\nnot authorized by the manufacturer. Under both systems, the new rules would make\nit easier for a dealer to display and sell multiple  brands in one store without\nthe need to maintain separate facilities.\n\n     The Commission also has proposed  sweeping  changes to the repair industry.\nDealers could no longer be required by the  manufacturer to perform repair work.\nInstead, dealers could subcontract the work to independent repair shops that met\nreasonable criteria set by the manufacturer.  These \"official\" repair facilities\ncould  perform  warranty  and  recall  work,  in  addition  to other  repair and\nmaintenance work. While a manufacturer  could continue to require the use of its\nparts in warranty and recall work,  the repair  facility could use parts made by\nothers that were of comparable quality for all other repair work.\n\n     It is difficult  to quantify at this time the full impact of these  changes\non our European operations. The Commission,  however, has stated that it expects\nthe new rules to lead to  increased  competition  and a narrowing  of car prices\nfrom country to country. The new rules, coupled with the introduction of the new\nsingle currency, are likely to put downward pressure on prices for both vehicles\nand vehicle parts. Our existing dealer agreements will be modified by October 1,\n2003 when the new rules are expected to apply.\n\n                                       7\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\n\nOther Markets\n-------------\n\n     Mexico and Canada.  Mexico and Canada also are important markets for us. In\n     -----------------\n2001, industry sales of new cars and trucks in Mexico were approximately 948,000\nunits, up  approximately 7% from 2000 levels.  In Canada,  industry sales of new\ncars and trucks in 2001 were approximately 1.59 million units, up 0.7% from 2000\nlevels.  Our combined  car and truck  market share in these  markets in 2001 was\n17.3% (Mexico) and 16.6% (Canada).\n\n     South  America.  Brazil and Argentina  are our  principal  markets in South\n     --------------\nAmerica. The economic environment in those countries has been volatile in recent\nyears,  leading to large  variations in industry  sales.  Results have also been\ninfluenced  by the  devaluation  of  the  Brazilian  Real  and  Argentina  Peso,\ncontinued weak economic  conditions and government  actions to reduce  inflation\nand public deficits. Industry sales in 2001 were 1.6 million units in Brazil, up\nabout 10% from 2000, and approximately 201,000 units in Argentina, down 41% from\n2000.  Our combined car and truck market share in these markets in 2001 was 7.8%\nin Brazil  (down 1.3% from last year) and 14.3% in  Argentina  (down 0.6% from a\nyear ago).\n\n     Ford has  undertaken  restructuring  actions in recent years to improve our\ncompetitiveness  in South America.  In addition,  we are building a new assembly\nplant in Brazil,  which will  manufacture a new family of vehicles for the South\nAmerican  markets.  The new plant will start  building the 5-door  Fiesta in the\nspring of 2002 and begin producing an all-new sport utility vehicle next year.\n\n     Asia Pacific. In the Asia Pacific region,  Australia,  Taiwan, Thailand and\n     ------------\nJapan are our principal markets. Industry volumes in 2001 in this region were as\nfollows:  approximately  773,000  units in  Australia  (down  1.9%  from  2000),\napproximately  347,400  units in Taiwan  (down 17.4% from  2000),  approximately\n297,000  units in Thailand  (up 13.4% from 2000) and  approximately  5.9 million\nunits in Japan (down 1.0% from 2000). In 2001, our combined car and truck market\nshare in Australia was 15.1%. In Taiwan,  we had a combined car and truck market\nshare in 2001 of 14.9%. In Thailand, our combined car and truck market share was\n6.5% in 2001.  Our  combined  car and truck  market share in Japan has been less\nthan 1% in recent years. We own a 33.4% interest in Mazda Motor  Corporation and\naccount for Mazda on an equity basis.  Mazda's market share in Japan has been in\nthe 5% range in recent  years.  Our  principal  competition  in the Asia Pacific\nregion has been the Japanese  manufacturers.  We anticipate  that the continuing\nrelaxation of import  restrictions  (including duty  reductions)  will intensify\ncompetition in the region.\n\n     We opened a new assembly plant in India in 1999, launching an all-new small\ncar (the Ikon) designed  specifically  for that market.  In 2001,  approximately\n14,800 Ikons were produced for sale in India. In addition,  India commenced sale\nof Ikon CKD (completely knocked down) kits to Mexico and South Africa, exporting\n28,150 CKD kits to these two countries in 2001. We expect India to become one of\nour most important markets in Asia in the future.\n\n     Africa.  In recent years, we have operated in the South African market as a\n     ------\n45% owner in the South African Motor Corporation (Pty.) Limited  (\"SAMCOR\").  In\n2000, we increased our  ownership  interest in SAMCOR to 100% by purchasing  the\nremaining 55% we did not previously own.  Subsequent to this purchase,  SAMCOR's\nname was changed to Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa (\"FMCSA\").\n\n     FMCSA assembles and distributes Ford, Mazda,  Volvo and, beginning in 2001,\nLand Rover  vehicles in South  Africa.  In addition,  FMCSA  distributes  Jaguar\nvehicles.  In 2001,  industry volume in South Africa was  approximately  367,000\nunits, up 7.6% from 2000 levels.  FMCSA's combined car and truck market share in\n2001 was 15.1% for the five brands it distributes.\n\n\n                                       8\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1.

This is the principal source of vehicle service and customer\nsupport for our vehicle owners within these brands,  traditionally recognized by\nthe Quality  CareSM brand.  Ford Customer  Service  Division's  first,  and most\ncritical,  role within the organization is to provide the service parts,  tools,\ntechnology & support to facilitate  the dealer network to achieve high levels of\ncustomer service  satisfaction and owner loyalty.  Beyond the traditional  Ford,\nLincoln and Mercury  Dealerships,  Ford  Customer  Service  Division  also works\ntogether  with the other Ford  trustmark  brands to optimize our dealer  service\nbusiness and share best practices.\n\n     Ford Customer Service Division was part of our former  Automotive  Consumer\nServices   Group  that  also   included  the   Diversified   Consumer   Services\nOrganization.  That  organization  contains  businesses that provide services to\nvehicle owners for all  automotive  brands.  As part of our  RevitalizationPlan,\ndiscussed below under Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of  Operations,\"  we plan to focus primarily on our dealer\nnetwork for traditional  vehicle service and customer support.  In addition,  we\nwill decrease our involvement in selected businesses in our Diversified Consumer\nServices  organization  -- we have  announced that we are evaluating the sale or\npartial  disposition  of  Kwik-Fit,  our European  maintenance  and light repair\nbusiness,  Collision Team of America,  a U.S. chain of collision  repair centers\nand  GreenLeaf  LLC, a chain of  automotive  recycling  centers in the U.S.  and\nCanada.\n\n     Through Ford Customer Service  Division's  e-Business  initiatives,  we are\nworking to manage our business in real time. By linking  together our suppliers,\ndealers and customers, we are able to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency\nof the  service  business  throughout  the  value  chain.  One  of the  greatest\ncompetitive  advantages  we can  provide to our dealers is the ability to easily\nobtain information such as:\n\n                o        Technical information from suppliers\n                o        Parts distribution status\n                o        Service problem diagnosis\n                o        Customer experience results\n\n                                       9\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1.

During the last quarter\nof 2001,  Ford  Credit  experienced  an increase  in account  delinquencies  and\nvehicle repossessions\n\n                                       12\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\n\nreflecting  significantly  weakening  economic  conditions  in the United States\nfollowing  the terrorist  attacks on September  11, 2001. As a result,  in 2001,\nFord Credit  increased its allowance for credit losses by $1.2 billion  compared\nwith 2000 year-end levels.\n\n     In response to higher credit losses,  Ford Credit implemented the following\nactions in 2001:\n\n     o    Refined its pricing and  financing  policies to reduce its exposure to\n          higher risk financing contracts,\n     o    Increased  service center staffing  levels,  improved  training of new\n          collectors, and enhanced segmentation strategies, and\n     o    Initiated further improvements in bankruptcy  predictors and portfolio\n          monitoring processes.\n\n     Ford Credit requires  substantial funding in the normal course of business.\nFord Credit's funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase\nretail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford\nproducts,  which to a large  extent are  influenced  by  Ford-sponsored  special\nfinancing  and leasing  programs  that are  available  exclusively  through Ford\nCredit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations.\n\n     Funding  sources for Ford  Credit  include  the sale of  commercial  paper,\nissuance of term debt, the sale of  receivables  and, in the case of Ford Credit\nEurope, the issuance of certificates of deposits to diverse investors in various\nmarkets.  The  ability of Ford  Credit to obtain  funds is  affected by its debt\nratings,  which are closely related to the outlook for, and financial  condition\nof, Ford and the nature and  availability of support  facilities.  The long-term\nsenior  debt of each of Ford,  Ford  Credit and Ford  Credit  Europe is rated as\nfollows by the three agencies that provide ratings:\n\n                                      Ford    Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe\n                                      ----    ----------------------------------\n        Fitch, Inc.

In addition,\nunder a support  agreement  with Ford Credit  Europe,  Ford Credit has agreed to\nmaintain Ford Credit  Europe's net worth above a minimum level. No payments were\nmade under either of these agreements during the period 1998 through 2001.\n\n     For further discussion of Ford Credit's credit losses,  funding sources and\nfunding  strategies,  see  Item 7.  \"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of\nFinancial  Condition  and Results of  Operations\".

Hertz  and  its\naffiliates, associates and independent licensees, do the following:\n\n     o    rent and lease cars and trucks\n     o    rent industrial and construction equipment\n     o    sell their used cars and equipment\n     o    provide third-party claim management services\n\n                                       13\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1.

In March\n2001,  through a cash tender  offer and a merger  transaction,  we acquired  the\npublicly  held  shares  and,  as  a  result,   Hertz  has  become  an  indirect,\nwholly-owned subsidiary of Ford.\n\n\n\n\n                             Governmental Standards\n\n     A number of  governmental  standards  and  regulations  relating to safety,\ncorporate  average fuel economy  (\"CAFE\"),  emissions  control,  noise  control,\ndamageability,  and theft  prevention  are  applicable  to new  motor  vehicles,\nengines,  and equipment  manufactured for sale in the United States,  Europe and\nelsewhere.  In addition,  manufacturing  and assembly  facilities  in the United\nStates,  Europe and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards  regulating air\nemissions,  water  discharges,  and  the  handling  and  disposal  of  hazardous\nsubstances.  Such facilities in the United States and Europe also are subject to\ncomprehensive national,  regional,  and/or local permit programs with respect to\nsuch matters.\n\n     Mobile Source Emissions Control -- U.S. Requirements. The Federal Clean Air\n     -------------------------------\nAct imposes stringent limits on the amount of regulated pollutants that lawfully\nmay be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines produced for sale in the United\nStates.  Currently,  most light duty  vehicles  sold in the United  States  must\ncomply  with these  standards  for 10 years or 100,000  miles,  whichever  first\noccurs.   The  U.S.   Environmental   Protection  Agency  (\"EPA\")  recently  has\npromulgated  post-2004  model year  standards  that are more  stringent than the\ndefault  standards  contained in the Clean Air Act. These new  regulations  will\nrequire most light duty trucks to meet the same emissions standards as passenger\ncars by the 2007 model year.  The stringency of the new standards may impact our\nability to produce and offer a broad range of products with the  characteristics\nand functionality  that customers  demand.  The new standards also are likely to\nlimit severely the use of diesel technology,  which could negatively impact fuel\neconomy performance.  The EPA also has promulgated  post-2004 emission standards\nfor  \"heavy-duty\"  trucks  (8,500-14,000  lbs.  gross  vehicle  weight).   These\nstandards are likely to pose technical challenges and may affect the competitive\nposition of full-line vehicle manufacturers such as Ford.\n\n     Pursuant to the Clean Air Act,  California  has  received a waiver from the\nEPA to establish its own unique emissions  control  standards.  New vehicles and\nengines sold in  California  must be certified by the  California  Air Resources\nBoard (\"CARB\").  CARB's emissions  requirements  (the \"California  program\") for\nmodel  years 1994  through  2003  require  manufacturers  to meet a  non-methane\norganic gases fleet average  requirement  that is  significantly  more stringent\nthan that prescribed by the Clean Air Act for the corresponding periods of time.\nIn late 1998, CARB adopted stringent new vehicle  emissions  standards that must\nbe phased in beginning in the 2004 model year.  These new  standards  treat most\nlight duty trucks the same as passenger  cars and require both types of vehicles\nto meet new stringent emissions requirements. It is also expected that these new\nstandards will essentially  eliminate the use of diesel  technology.  CARB's new\nstandards present a difficult engineering and technological  challenge,  and may\nimpact our  ability  to produce  and offer a broad  range of  products  with the\ncharacteristics and functionality that customers demand.\n\n                                       14\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\n\n     Since  1990,  the  California   program  has  included   requirements   for\nmanufacturers to produce and deliver for sale \"zero-emission vehicles\" (the \"ZEV\nmandate\").  The ZEV mandate  initially  required that a specified  percentage of\neach manufacturer's vehicles produced for sale in California, beginning at 2% in\n1998 and increasing to 10% in 2003,  must be  zero-emission  vehicles  (\"ZEVs\"),\nwhich produce no emissions of regulated pollutants. In 1996, CARB eliminated the\nZEV mandate for the  1998-2002  model  years,  but retained the 10% mandate in a\nmodified form beginning with the 2003 model year. Around the same time,  vehicle\nmanufacturers  voluntarily  entered  into  agreements  with CARB to conduct  ZEV\ndemonstration programs.\n\n     In January 2001, CARB voted to approve a series of complex modifications to\nthe ZEV mandate. These modifications require large-volume  manufacturers such as\nFord to produce \"partial zero-emission vehicles\" (\"PZEVs\") and/or ZEVs beginning\nin  the  2003  model  year.   PZEVs  are  vehicles   certified  to  California's\n\"super-ultra-low  emission  vehicle\"  (\"SULEV\")  tailpipe  standards,  with zero\nevaporative emissions. Using a series of phase-in tables and credit adjustments,\nthe  number  of  ZEVs  required   under  the  modified   mandate  will  increase\nsubstantially between 2003 and 2018. The California Office of Administrative Law\nrefused to approve these rules due to procedural  defects,  so the modifications\nstill have not been  finalized.  We anticipate that CARB will attempt to correct\nthe defects and finalize the rules in 2002.\n\n     The Clean Air Act permits  other states that do not meet  national  ambient\nair quality standards to adopt  California's motor vehicle emission standards no\nlater than two years before the affected  model year.  New York,  Massachusetts,\nVermont,  and Maine adopted the  California  standards  effective  with the 2001\nmodel  year  or  before.  New  York,  Massachusetts,  and  Vermont  have  either\npreviously  adopted,  or indicated an intention  to adopt,  the  California  ZEV\nmandate.  Maryland and New Jersey have laws requiring the adoption of California\nstandards if certain  triggers are met.  There are  problems  with  transferring\nCalifornia  standards to  northeast  states,  including  the  following:  1) the\ndriving range of ZEVs is greatly  diminished in cold weather,  thereby  limiting\ntheir  market  appeal;  and 2) the  northeast  states have  refused to adopt the\nCalifornia  reformulated gasoline  regulations,  which may impair the ability of\nvehicles to meet California's  in-use standards.  New York and Massachusetts are\nin the  process  of  finalizing  rules  that give  manufacturers  the  option of\ncomplying with the  California  ZEV mandate or with an alternative  program that\nmay make compliance  more feasible in those states;  it is likely that Ford will\nchoose the alternative  program.  It is anticipated  that Vermont will adopt the\nlatest version of the ZEV mandate once it becomes final in California.\n\n     Battery electric  vehicles are the only  zero-emission  vehicles  currently\nfeasible for mass production.  Despite intensive  research  activities,  battery\ntechnology  has not made the  major  strides  that were  projected  when the ZEV\nmandate  was  originally  enacted  in  1990.  Battery-electric  vehicles  remain\nconsiderably  more  costly  than  gasoline-powered  vehicles,  and  they  have a\nrelatively  short  driving  range before they must be  recharged.  These factors\nlimit the consumer appeal of battery-powered vehicles. Ford plans to comply with\nthe early years of the modified ZEV mandate  through sales of its TH!NK brand of\nelectric  vehicles,  along with one or more PZEV  models.  In the  longer  term,\nhowever,  it is doubtful  whether the market will  support the number of battery\nelectric  vehicles called for by the modified ZEV mandate.  Fuel cell technology\nmay in the future enable production of ZEVs with widespread consumer appeal, but\ncommercially  feasible fuel cell technology appears to be a decade or more away.\nCompliance with the ZEV mandate may eventually require costly actions that would\nhave a  substantial  adverse  effect on Ford's  sales  volume and  profits.  For\nexample,  we could be  required  to curtail  the sale of  non-electric  vehicles\nand/or offer to sell electric vehicles well below cost. Other states may seek to\nadopt CARB's ZEV mandate pursuant to the Clean Air Act,  thereby  increasing the\ncosts to Ford. Other  automobile  manufacturers,  along with some dealers,  have\nfiled suit in state and federal  court  seeking to eliminate  the ZEV mandate on\nvarious procedural and substantive grounds.\n\n     Under the  Clean Air Act,  the EPA and CARB can  require  manufacturers  to\nrecall and repair  non-conforming  vehicles.  The EPA,  through  its  testing of\nproduction vehicles, also can halt the shipment of non-conforming vehicles. Ford\nmay be required to recall, or may voluntarily recall, vehicles for such purposes\nin the future. The costs of related repairs or inspections  associated with such\nrecalls can be substantial.\n\n                                       15\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\n\n     European  Requirements.   European  Union  (\"EU\")  directives  and  related\nlegislation limit the amount of regulated  pollutants that may be emitted by new\nmotor  vehicles  and  engines  sold in the EU.  In 1998,  the EU  adopted  a new\ndirective on emissions  from passenger cars and light  commercial  trucks.  More\nstringent  emissions  standards  applied  to new  car  certifications  beginning\nJanuary 1, 2000 and to new car  registrations  beginning January 1, 2001 (\"Stage\nIII Standards\").  A second level of even more stringent  emission standards will\napply  to new  car  certifications  beginning  January  1,  2005  and to new car\nregistrations  beginning January 1, 2006 (\"Stage IV Standards\").  The comparable\nlight  commercial  truck Stage III Standards  and Stage IV Standards  would come\ninto effect one year later than the  passenger car  requirements.  The directive\nincludes  a  framework  that  permits  EU  member  states  to  introduce  fiscal\nincentives  to  promote  early  compliance  with  the  Stage  III and  Stage  IV\nStandards. The directive also introduces on-board diagnostic requirements,  more\nstringent evaporative emission  requirements,  and in-service compliance testing\nand recall provisions for emissions-related defects that occur in the first five\nyears or 80,000  kilometers of vehicle life  (extended to 100,000  kilometers in\n2005).  The  Stage IV  Standards  for  diesel  engines  are not yet  technically\nfeasible  and may impact  our  ability  to  produce  and offer a broad  range of\nproducts with the  characteristics  and  functionality  that customers demand. A\nrelated EU directive  was adopted at the same time which  establishes  standards\nfor cleaner fuels  beginning in 2000 and even cleaner  fuels in 2005.  The EU is\nsetting up a program to assess the need for further changes to vehicle  emission\nand fuel standards after 2005.\n\n     Certain  European  countries are  conducting  in-use  emissions  testing to\nascertain  compliance of motor  vehicles with  applicable  emissions  standards.\nThese  actions  could lead to recalls of  vehicles;  the future costs of related\ninspection or repairs could be substantial.\n\n     Motor Vehicle Safety -- U.S.  Requirements.  The National Traffic and Motor\n     --------------------\nVehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the \"Safety Act\") regulates motor vehicles and motor\nvehicle  equipment in the United States in two primary ways.  First,  the Safety\nAct prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that\ndoes not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by the\nNational Highway Traffic Safety  Administration  (the \"Safety  Administration\").\nMeeting or exceeding many safety  standards is costly because the standards tend\nto conflict with the need to reduce  vehicle  weight in order to meet  emissions\nand fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related\nto motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns.  There were\npending  before  the  Safety  Administration   approximately  32  investigations\nrelating to alleged  safety  defects in Ford vehicles as of February 28, 2002. A\nmanufacturer  also is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that they do\nnot comply  with a safety  standard.  Should  Ford or the Safety  Administration\ndetermine that either a safety defect or a noncompliance  exists with respect to\ncertain  of  Ford's  vehicles,  the  costs  of such  recall  campaigns  could be\nsubstantial.\n\n     The Transportation  Recall Enhancement,  Accountability,  and Documentation\nAct (the  \"TREAD  Act\") was  signed  into law in  November  2000.  The TREAD Act\nestablishes  new  reporting  requirements  for  motor  vehicles,  motor  vehicle\nequipment,   and  tires,   including  reporting  to  the  Safety  Administration\ninformation on foreign recalls and information received by the manufacturer that\nmay assist the agency in the identification of safety defects. The obligation of\nvehicle  manufacturers  to provide,  on a cost-free basis, a remedy for vehicles\nwith an identified safety defect or non-compliance  issue is extended from eight\nyears to ten years by the new  legislation.  The Safety  Administration  is also\nrequired  to develop a new dynamic  test on  rollovers  to be used for  consumer\ninformation.  Potential  civil penalties are increased from $1,000 to $5,000 per\nday for certain statutory violations,  with a maximum penalty of $15,000,000 for\na related series of violations.  Similar penalties are included for violation of\nthe reporting  requirements.  Criminal  penalties are introduced for persons who\nmake false statements to the government or withhold  information with the intent\nto mislead the government about safety defects that have caused death or serious\nbodily injury.  Currently,  there is substantial  rulemaking activity related to\nseveral TREAD Act  requirements  and final rules are expected to be  promulgated\nthroughout 2002 creating significant  additional  regulatory burdens for vehicle\nmanufacturers.\n\n     Foreign  Requirements.  Canada,  the EU, individual member countries within\nthe EU,  and other  countries  in Europe,  South  America  and the Asia  Pacific\nmarkets also have safety  standards  applicable to motor vehicles and are likely\nto adopt additional or more stringent standards in the future.\n\n                                       16\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\n\n     Motor  Vehicle  Fuel  Economy  -- U.S.  Requirements.  Under  federal  law,\n     -----------------------------\nvehicles must meet minimum Corporate Average Fuel Economy (\"CAFE\") standards set\nby  the  Safety  Administration.   A  manufacturer  is  subject  to  potentially\nsubstantial  civil  penalties if it fails to meet the CAFE standard in any model\nyear,  after taking into account all available  credits for the preceding  three\nmodel years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years.\n\n     The law  established a passenger car CAFE standard of 27.5 mpg for 1985 and\nlater model years, which the Safety Administration believes it has the authority\nto amend to a level it determines to be the maximum  feasible level.  The Safety\nAdministration  has  established  a 20.7 mpg CAFE  standard  applicable to light\ntrucks.\n\n     Ford expects to be able to comply with the  foregoing  CAFE  standards,  in\nsome cases using credits from prior or  succeeding  model years.  In general,  a\ncontinued  increase  in demand for larger  vehicles,  coupled  with a decline in\ndemand for small and middle-size vehicles could jeopardize our long-term ability\nto maintain compliance with CAFE standards.\n\n     The CAFE standards will likely increase in the near future.  Both the House\nand Senate have passed  separate bills  directing the Safety  Administration  to\nestablish new fuel economy standards for upcoming model years. It is anticipated\nthat a measure similar to these bills will be enacted into law during 2002. Even\nif  Congress   does  not  pass  such  a  law,  it  is  likely  that  the  Safety\nAdministration  will  use  its  existing  rulemaking   authority  to  promulgate\nincreases in light truck fuel economy standards.  The Safety  Administration has\nrecently  requested  public  comment  on the  advisability  and  feasibility  of\nincreasing light truck standards in the 2005-2010 time frame.\n\n     Pressure  to  increase  CAFE  standards  stems in part from  concerns  over\ngreenhouse gas emissions,  which may affect the global climate.  With respect to\ngreenhouse  gas  emissions,  the Bush  administration  released a climate change\npolicy  initiative  in February  2002.  The Bush  administration  plan  stresses\nvoluntary measures and a cap-and-trade  program to stem the growth of greenhouse\ngas  emissions.  The Bush  administration  also has  launched  the  Freedom  Car\ninitiative,  which  supports  research  for fuel  cell-powered  vehicles.  Other\nnations continue to press for United States ratification of the so-called \"Kyoto\nProtocol,\"  which  would  require  the United  States to reduce  greenhouse  gas\nemissions by 7% below its 1990 levels.  The Kyoto  Protocol  does not  currently\nhave the support of either the Bush  administration or Congress.  Separately,  a\npetition has been filed with the EPA requesting  that it regulate carbon dioxide\n(CO2, a greenhouse  gas)  emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act.\nEPA has  requested  public  comment on this petition but has not taken action to\ndate.  Some states,  including  California,  are also  proposing to regulate CO2\nemissions from motor vehicles.\n\n     If  significant  increases in CAFE  standards for upcoming  model years are\nimposed, or if EPA or other agencies regulate CO2 emissions from motor vehicles,\nFord might find it  necessary  to take  various  costly  actions that could have\nsubstantial adverse effects on its sales volume and profits.  For example,  Ford\nmight have to curtail  production  of larger,  family-size  and luxury  cars and\nfull-size light trucks,  restrict offerings of engines and popular options,  and\nincrease  market  support  programs for its most  fuel-efficient  cars and light\ntrucks.\n\n     Foreign Requirements.  The EU also is a party to the Kyoto Protocol and has\nagreed to reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions by 8% below their 1990 levels during\nthe 2008-2012  period.  In December  1997,  the European  Council of Environment\nMinisters (the \"Environment  Council\") reaffirmed its goal to reduce average CO2\nemissions  from new cars to 120 grams per  kilometer by 2010 (at the latest) and\ninvited  European  motor  vehicle  manufacturers  to negotiate  further with the\nEuropean Commission on a satisfactory voluntary  environmental agreement to help\nachieve this goal.  In October 1998,  the EU agreed to support an  environmental\nagreement with the European Automotive Manufacturers  Association (of which Ford\nis  a  member)  on  CO2  emission   reductions  from  new  passenger  cars  (the\n\"Agreement\").  The Agreement  establishes an emission target of 140 grams of CO2\nper  kilometer  for the average of new cars sold in the EU by the  Association's\nmembers in 2008. In addition,  the Agreement  provides that certain  Association\nmembers  (including  Ford) will introduce models emitting no more than 120 grams\nof CO2 per\n\n                                       17\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\n\nkilometer in 2000, and establishes an estimated target range of 165-170 grams of\nCO2 per  kilometer for the average of new cars sold in 2003.  Also in 2003,  the\nAssociation will review the potential for additional CO2 reductions, with a view\nto moving further toward the EU's objective.  The Agreement assumes (among other\nthings) that no negative measures will be implemented against diesel-fueled cars\nand the full  availability  of improved  fuels with low sulfur  content in 2005.\nAverage  CO2  emissions  of 140  grams  per  kilometer  for new  passenger  cars\ncorresponds to a 25% reduction in average CO2 emissions compared to 1995.\n\n     The Environment Council requested the European Commission to review in 2003\nthe EU's progress  toward reaching the 120 gram target by 2010, and to implement\nannual  monitoring  of the average CO2  emissions  from new  passenger  cars and\nprogress toward achievement of the objectives for 2000 and 2003.\n\n     In  1995,  members  of  the  German  Automobile  Manufacturers  Association\n(including  Ford  Werke  AG) made a  voluntary  pledge to  increase  by 2005 the\naverage  fuel  economy of new cars sold in Germany by 25% from 1990  levels,  to\nmake regular reports on fuel consumption,  and to increase industry research and\ndevelopment  efforts  toward  this  end.  The  German  Automobile  Manufacturers\nAssociation has reported that the industry is on track to meet the pledge.\n\n     Other European countries are considering other initiatives for reducing CO2\nemissions  from  motor  vehicles.  Taken  together,  such  proposals  could have\nsubstantial adverse effects on our sales volumes and profits in Europe.\n\n     Japan has adopted automobile fuel consumption goals that manufacturers must\nattempt to achieve by the 2000 model year. The consumption  levels apply only to\ngasoline-powered  vehicles,  vary by vehicle weight,  and range from 5.8 km/l to\n19.2 km/l.\n\n     End-of-Life  Vehicle  Proposal -- The European  Parliament  has published a\n     ------------------------------\ndirective  imposing an obligation on motor  vehicle  manufacturers  to take back\nend-of-life  vehicles with zero or negative value registered after July 1, 2002,\nand to take back all other  end-of-life  vehicles with zero or negative value as\nof January 1, 2007,  with no cost to the last owner.  The Directive also imposes\nrequirements  on the  proportion  of the  vehicle  that  may be  disposed  of in\nlandfills and the proportion that must be reused or recycled  beginning in 2006,\nand bans the use of certain  substances  in  vehicles  beginning  with  vehicles\nregistered  after July 2003.  Member states may apply these  provisions prior to\nthe dates mentioned above.\n\n     Presently,  there  are  numerous  uncertainties  surrounding  the  form and\nimplementation  of  the  legislation  in  different  member  states,  especially\nregarding manufacturers' responsibilities and the resultant expenses that may be\nincurred.  Depending on the  individual  member  states'  legislation  and other\ncircumstances,  we may be  required  to accrue  the costs  represented  by these\nregulations in our 2002 financial statements. The directive should not, however,\nresult in significant cash expenditures before 2007.\n\n     Pollution  Control  Costs -- During the period 2002 through 2006, we expect\n     -------------------------\nto  spend  approximately  $391  million  on  our  North  American  and  European\nfacilities to comply with air and water  pollution  and hazardous  waste control\nstandards, which now are in effect or are scheduled to come into effect. Of this\ntotal, we estimate spending approximately $73 million in 2002 and $93 million in\n2003.\n\n                                  18\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1.

The increase  reflects  the full year effect of  acquisitions  and\nnewly consolidated subsidiaries (Land Rover, Ford Motor Company Southern Africa,\nCollision  Team of America).  The numbers  above  include  approximately  20,500\nhourly employees of Ford who are assigned to Visteon Corporation,  and, pursuant\nto our collective  bargaining  agreement with the United Automobile Workers (the\n\"UAW\"),  remain Ford  employees.  Visteon  reimburses Ford for all costs to Ford\nassociated  with these  employees.  Most of our employees work in our Automotive\noperations.\n\n     For further information  regarding employment  statistics of Ford, see Item\n6. \"Selected  Financial Data\" later in this Report.  For information  concerning\nemployee retirement benefits, see Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements at the end of this Report.\n\n     Substantially  all of the hourly employees in our Automotive  operations in\nthe United States are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining\nagreements.  Approximately  99%  of  these  unionized  hourly  employees  in our\nAutomotive segment are represented by the UAW.  Approximately 2% of our salaried\nemployees  are   represented   by  unions.   Most  hourly   employees  and  many\nnon-management  salaried employees of our subsidiaries outside the United States\nalso are represented by unions.\n\n     We have entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the UAW that is\nscheduled  to  expire  on  September  14,  2003.  We also  have  entered  into a\ncollective  bargaining  agreement with the Canadian  Automobile  Workers (\"CAW\")\nthat is scheduled  to expire on September  17,  2002.  Among other  things,  our\nagreements  with the UAW and CAW provide for guaranteed  wage and benefit levels\nthroughout  their terms and provide for significant  employment  security.  As a\npractical  matter,  these agreements  restrict our ability to eliminate  product\nlines, close plants, and divest businesses.  These agreements can also limit our\nability to change  local  work  rules and  practices.  Our  Revitalization  Plan\nassumes  full  compliance  with  our  obligations   under  existing   collective\nbargaining agreements.  Negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements with\nthe UAW and CAW could result in our incurring  costs  different  than  currently\nanticipated.\n\n     We are or will be negotiating  new collective  bargaining  agreements  with\nlabor  unions  in Europe  (as well as Mexico  and Asia  Pacific)  where  current\nagreements  will expire in 2002.  A  protracted  work  stoppage in Europe  could\nsubstantially adversely affect Ford's profits.\n\n     In  recent  years  we  have  not  had  significant  work  stoppages  at our\nfacilities,  but they have occurred in some of our suppliers' facilities. A work\nstoppage  could occur as a result of disputes  under our  collective  bargaining\nagreements  with  labor  unions  or  in  connection  with  negotiations  of  new\ncollective  bargaining  agreements,  which, if protracted,  could  substantially\nadversely  affect our  business  and results of  operation.  Work  stoppages  at\nsupplier  facilities for labor or other reasons could have similar  consequences\nif  alternate  sources of  components  are not readily  available.  Our Canadian\nfacilities,  which are covered by the CAW agreement  expiring in September 2002,\ninclude  facilities that are the primary source of engines for many of our truck\nand sport utility models, which are among our most profitable models. Therefore,\nany protracted  work stoppage at our Canadian  facilities in connection with the\nnegotiation  of a new collective  bargaining  agreement with the CAW will have a\nsubstantial adverse effect on our business.\n\n                                       19\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\n\n     In addition to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, we entered\ninto a  separate  agreement  with  the UAW in  connection  with  the sale of our\nDearborn steel-making operations to Rouge Industries, Inc., then known as Marico\nAcquisition  Corp.,  in  1989.  As part of the  sale,  employees  of our  former\nsteel-making  operations became employees of Rouge Steel Company, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Rouge Industries,  Inc. (\"Rouge\").  Pursuant to the UAW agreement,\nwe agreed  that  Rouge  hourly  employees  who,  at the time of the  sale,  were\nrepresented by the UAW and met certain seniority  requirements  would be allowed\nto return to Ford to work in one of our Rouge area  plants if they were laid off\nby Rouge in the future as a result of a layoff of unknown duration,  a permanent\ndiscontinuance  of  operations  by Rouge or a sale of the  assets of Rouge.  The\nright to return  remains in effect with respect to each eligible  employee for a\nperiod  equal to the  employee's  Ford  seniority  as of the date of the sale by\nFord.  Approximately 1,000 former Ford employees currently employed by Rouge are\ncovered by this agreement. In part to avoid the occurrence of one or more of the\ntriggering events described above, we have extended subordinated credit to Rouge\ntotaling  $90  million.  In its  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31,  2001,  Rouge  stated that it has  suffered  recurring  losses from\noperations  and  negative  cash  flows that raise  substantial  doubt  about its\nability to continue as a going concern.\n\n\n\n\n                      Engineering, Research and Development\n\n     We conduct engineering,  research and development  primarily to improve the\nperformance (including fuel efficiency), safety and customer satisfaction of our\nproducts,  and to develop new products.  We also have staffs of  scientists  who\nengage in basic research. We maintain extensive engineering, research and design\nfacilities for these purposes,  including  large centers in Dearborn,  Michigan;\nDunton,  England; and Merkenich,  Germany.  Most of our engineering research and\ndevelopment relates to our Automotive operating segment.\n\n     During the last three years, we took charges to our consolidated income for\nengineering,  research and  development  we sponsored in the  following  amounts\n(restated for prior years to exclude Visteon): $7.4 billion (2001), $6.8 billion\n(2000), and $6.0 billion (1999). Any customer-sponsored research and development\nactivities that we conduct are not material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem 2.  Properties\n-------------------\n\n     We own substantially all of our U.S. manufacturing and assembly facilities.\nThese  facilities  are  situated in various  sections of the country and include\nassembly  plants,  engine plants,  casting plants,  metal stamping  plants,  and\ntransmission  plants.  We also own a  majority  of our sales  offices,  with the\nremainder  being leased.  Most of our  distribution  centers and  warehouses are\nleased (approximately 26% are owned).\n\n     In  addition,  we  maintain  and  operate  manufacturing  plants,  assembly\nfacilities,  parts  distribution  centers,  and engineering  centers outside the\nUnited States. We own substantially  all of the manufacturing  plants,  assembly\nfacilities,  and  engineering  centers.  The majority of our parts  distribution\ncenters  outside of the United  States are either  leased or provided by vendors\nunder service contracts.\n\n     Our Automotive  segment operates  approximately 96 plants; 126 distribution\ncenters/ warehouses; and 53 engineering and research and development centers.\n\n\n                                       20\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 2. Properties (Continued)\n\n     In recent  years,  we have sold or  contributed  certain of our  automotive\nassets to entities in which we are a joint venture partner. These joint ventures\noperate  approximately  17 plants that formerly were operated by our  Automotive\nsegment.  Because we do not control these joint ventures,  but have  significant\ninfluence over their operating and financial policies,  these joint ventures are\nnot  consolidated  with  us for  financial  reporting  purposes,  but  they  are\naccounted  for in our financial  statements  using the equity  method.  The most\nsignificant of these joint ventures are:\n\n\n          o    Getrag  Ford  Transmissions  GmbH -- a 50/50 joint  venture  with\n               Getrag  Deutsche  Venture  GmbH & Co. KG., a German  company,  to\n               which we transferred our European manual transmission  operations\n               in Halewood,  England, Cologne, Germany and Bordeaux, France. The\n               Getrag  joint  venture  produces  manual  transmissions  for  our\n               European vehicle  assembly  operations.  Ford currently  supplies\n               most  of  the  hourly  and  salaried  labor  requirements  of the\n               operations   transferred  to  the  Getrag  joint  venture.

Legal Proceedings\n--------------------------\n\n     Various legal actions,  governmental  investigations  and  proceedings  and\nclaims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us and\nour  subsidiaries,  including,  but not  limited  to,  those  arising out of the\nfollowing:  alleged defects in our products;  governmental  regulations covering\nsafety,  emissions,  and fuel economy;  financial  services;  employment-related\nmatters;  dealer,  supplier, and other contractual  relationships;  intellectual\nproperty rights;  product  warranties;  environmental  matters;  and shareholder\nmatters. Some of the pending legal actions are, or purport to be, class actions.\nSome of the foregoing matters involve or may involve  compensatory,  punitive or\nantitrust or other  multiplied  damage claims in very large amounts,  or demands\nfor recall campaigns,  environmental  remediation  programs,  sanctions or other\nrelief that,  if granted,  would  require very large  expenditures.  See Item 1.\n\"Business-Governmental Standards\". We regularly evaluate the expected outcome of\nproduct  liability  litigation  and other  litigation  matters.  We have accrued\nexpenses for probable  losses on product  liability  matters,  in the aggregate,\nbased on an analysis of historical litigation payouts and trends.  Expenses also\nhave been accrued for other litigation  where losses are deemed probable.  These\naccruals  have  been  reflected  in our  financial  statements.  Following  is a\ndiscussion of our significant pending legal proceedings:\n\nFirestone Matters\n-----------------\n\n     Recall and National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  Matters.  On\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAugust 9, 2000, Bridgestone/Firestone,  Inc. (\"Firestone\") announced a recall of\nall Firestone ATX and ATX II tires (P235/75R15)  produced in North America since\n1991 and  Wilderness  AT tires of that same  size  manufactured  at  Firestone's\nDecatur,  Illinois  plant.  Firestone  estimated  that about 6.5  million of the\naffected tires were still in service on the date the recall was  announced.  The\nrecall was announced following an analysis by Ford and Firestone that identified\na  statistically  significant  incidence  of tread  separation  occurring in the\naffected tires. Most of the affected tires were installed as original  equipment\non Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles.  This original recall was substantially\ncompleted by the end of the first quarter 2001.\n\n     The Safety Administration  investigated the tread separation matter both to\nmake a root cause assessment and to determine whether  Firestone's recall should\nbe expanded to include other Firestone  tires.  We actively  cooperated with the\nSafety  Administration in their investigation.  As a result of our work with the\nSafety  Administration  with regard to its  investigation  of the Firestone tire\nrecall and our own root cause  analysis,  we  announced  on May 22, 2001 that we\nwould replace all remaining  15, 16, and 17-inch  Firestone  Wilderness AT tires\n(about 13 million tires) on our vehicles. This precautionary action was based on\nour analysis of data on the actual road performance of these tires,  comparisons\nwith the  performance  of  comparable  tires by other tire  makers,  a review of\ninformation  developed  by and  received  from the  Safety  Administration,  and\nextensive laboratory and vehicle testing.\n\n     As a result of its investigations,  the Safety Administration on October 4,\n2001 issued its determination  that 3.5 million Wilderness AT tires manufactured\nbefore May 1998,  which  tires  were  subject to our  replacement  program,  are\ndefective,  and said that Firestone had agreed to recall those tires.  About 2.5\nmillion of the  defective  tires are estimated to have been in service as of May\n2001 (when  Ford's  replacement  program was  announced),  and consist of 15 and\n16-inch  Wilderness AT tires manufactured prior to May 1998 and supplied to Ford\nas original equipment or sold as replacement equipment.\n\n     On February 12, 2002, the Safety  Administration issued a report denying an\nearlier  request for an  investigation  into the handling  and  stability of the\nExplorer  after a tread  separation.  In its report,  the Safety  Administration\nspecifically  analyzed and rejected each of allegations made in the request. The\nSafety  Administration  based its  denial on both a  technical  analysis  of the\nsteering  and  handling  of the  Explorer as well as a review of crash data that\nindicated \"no  significant  difference in the likelihood of a crash  following a\ntread separation between Explorer vehicles and other compact SUVs.\"\n\n                                       22\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)\n\n     Firestone   Tire   Related   Litigation.   In  the   United   States,   the\n     ---------------------------------------\nabove-described  defect in certain Firestone tires, most of which were installed\nas original  equipment on Ford  Explorers,  has led to a  significant  number of\npersonal  injury and class action  lawsuits  against Ford and  Firestone.  These\ncases are described in detail below.\n\n     Firestone Personal Injury Actions.  Plaintiffs in the personal injury cases\ntypically  allege  that their  injuries  were caused by defects in the tire that\ncaused it to lose its tread  and/or by defects in the  Explorer  that caused the\nvehicle to roll over.  We are a  defendant  in these  actions  and,  as with all\nlitigation facing the Company,  are investigating the circumstances  surrounding\nthe  accidents and preparing to defend our product in the event we are unable to\nreach reasonable resolution.\n\n     Firestone Class Actions.  Five purported class actions are pending in which\nplaintiffs  seek  to  represent  persons  who own (or at one  time  owned)  Ford\nExplorers with Firestone tires: one in federal court in Indianapolis and four in\nstate courts in Pennsylvania,  Wisconsin,  South Carolina and Illinois. (A total\nof about 96  Firestone-related  class actions were originally  filed, but almost\nall of these  have been  consolidated  into the one case now  pending in federal\ncourt in Indianapolis.) These actions were brought on behalf of persons who have\nnever been injured in an accident involving Firestone tires. They seek to expand\nthe scope of the recall to include  other  tires,  the cost of  replacing  those\ntires, the alleged  diminution in vehicle value caused by the use of those tires\nor by the  alleged  instability  of  Explorers,  or the amount by which Ford was\n\"unjustly  enriched\" through inflated wholesale prices.  They also seek punitive\ndamages.\n\n     In the federal  case,  our motion to dismiss that  complaint was granted in\npart and  denied in part.  The court  ruled  that,  under the  National  Highway\nTraffic  Safety Act, the Safety  Administration  has the exclusive  authority to\norder and supervise automotive recalls.  Accordingly,  the court dismissed those\nportions of the class action  complaints that sought recall of additional  tires\nor court supervision of the recall and the tire replacement  program.  The court\nalso  dismissed  some of the claims for damages.  However,  the court refused to\ndismiss the plaintiffs' warranty and unjust enrichment claims.\n\n     On November 28, 2001,  the federal  court  certified a class  consisting of\n\"[a]ll  current  residents of the United States who either (a) owned or leased a\n1991  through  2001 model year Ford  Explorer  as of August 9, 2000 . . . or (b)\nowned or leased a 1991 through 2001 model year Ford Explorer  prior to August 9,\n2000 . . .\" The court  also  certified  a class  consisting  of  \"[a]ll  current\nresidents of the United  States who owned or leased at any time from 1990 to the\npresent, vehicles that are or were equipped with Firestone ATX, ATX II, Firehawk\nATX, ATX 23 Degree,  Widetrack Radial Baja, and Wilderness tires; all tires that\nare the same as Firestone  ATX, ATX II,  Firehawk ATX, ATX 23 Degree,  Widetrack\nRadial Baja, and Wilderness tires but sold by Firestone under other brand names;\nand  all  other  tires  manufactured  by  Firestone  that  are  the  same or are\nsubstantially  similar to Firestone  ATX, ATX II,  Firehawk  ATX, ATX 23 Degree,\nWidetrack Radial Baja and Wilderness  tires.\" The United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Seventh Circuit has granted our petition to review this ruling.\n\n     The state trial court in South Carolina has certified a class of all owners\nof Wilderness  AT or ATX tires  installed on Ford  Explorers,  but our motion to\ndismiss that case is still pending.\n\n     Firestone  Shareholder   Derivative  Actions.  Two  shareholder  derivative\nactions are pending  against the Board of Directors  with the Company named as a\nnominal defendant.  Both actions are in Michigan,  one in state court and one in\nfederal  court.  The  actions  allege  that the  Board  members  breached  their\nfiduciary duties to the Company and shareholders by failing to inform themselves\nadequately regarding Firestone tires, failing to insure that the Explorer design\nwas safe,  failing to report  problems  with  Firestone  tires and to stop using\nFirestone tires as original equipment, failing to recall all affected tires on a\nglobal basis as soon as problems were known,  and mismanaging the recall once it\nwas announced.  The actions also allege breach of fiduciary  duties by the Board\nwith  respect  to the use of  distributor-mounted  thick film  ignition  (\"TFI\")\nmodules.  The plaintiffs  seek  injunctive  relief and damages,  a\n\n                                       23\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)\n\nreturn of all Director  compensation  during the period of the alleged  breaches\nand attorneys  fees. By agreement of the parties the state court action has been\nadministratively  stayed pending the outcome of the federal court action. In the\nfederal court action, Ford has filed a motion to dismiss.\n\n     Firestone  Securities Class Actions.  One purported nationwide class action\nagainst the Company was filed in federal  court in Detroit  alleging  securities\nfraud and  violations of Rule 10b-5 on behalf of all persons who purchased  Ford\nstock during the period from March 1998 through  August  2000.  (Seven  separate\nclass action complaints were filed initially,  but all seven complaints have now\nbeen replaced by one master  complaint.) The plaintiffs allege that, during that\nperiod of time, the defendants made misrepresentations  about the safety of Ford\nproducts and the Explorer in particular,  and failed to disclose  material facts\nabout  problems with Firestone  tires and the safety of Explorers  equipped with\nFirestone   tires.   The   plaintiffs   claim   that,   as  a  result  of  these\nmisrepresentations  or omissions,  they purchased Ford stock at inflated  prices\nand were  damaged  when the price of the stock  fell  upon  announcement  of the\nrecall and  subsequent  revelations.  On December 10, 2001 the federal  district\ncourt granted  Ford's motion to dismiss and  dismissed the  consolidated  action\nwith  prejudice.  Plaintiffs  have  moved  to  amend  the  judgment  to make the\ndismissal without prejudice and for leave to file an amended complaint.\n\n     Venezuelan Matters.  In Venezuela,  the Attorney General's Office continues\n     ------------------\nto investigate  whether criminal  charges should be filed against  Firestone and\nFord employees as a result of tire tread  separation  accidents that occurred in\nthat country. The Venezuelan consumer protection agency (INDECU) is assisting in\nthis  investigation.   In  a  separate  investigation  being  conducted  by  the\nVenezuelan  National  Assembly   concerning  the  cause  of  the  accidents,   a\npreliminary  report was filed on  December 5, 2001 by the  Technical  Commission\nappointed  to  conduct  the  investigation.  The  report  did  not  contain  any\nconclusions  regarding  the cause of the  accidents;  it only  detailed the work\nperformed  by the  committee  up to  that  date.  It is not  clear  whether  the\ncommittee will submit a final report.\n\n\nOther Product Liability Matters\n-------------------------------\n\n     Asbestos Matters. Along with other vehicle manufacturers,  we have been the\n     ----------------\ntarget of  asbestos  litigation.  We are a  defendant  in  various  actions  for\ninjuries  claimed to have resulted from alleged  contact with certain Ford parts\nand other products containing  asbestos.  Asbestos was used in brakes,  clutches\nand other auto  components  from  1927-1997.  We no longer use  asbestos  in our\nvehicles.\n\n     Most of the asbestos litigation we face involves mechanics that worked with\nbrakes over the years,  although we have some cases that relate to the  presence\nof  asbestos  in our  facilities.  In most of  these  cases  we are not the sole\ndefendant.  We believe we are becoming more aggressively targeted in these suits\nas a result of the  bankruptcy  filings of companies that have been the previous\ntargets of asbestos  litigation.  As with all litigation facing the Company,  we\nare  prepared  to defend  these  asbestos  related  cases.  We believe  that the\nscientific  evidence confirms our long-standing  position that mechanics are not\nat an  increased  risk of  asbestos  related  disease as a result of exposure to\nasbestos used in the Company's vehicles.\n\n     The  majority  of these  cases do not  specify a dollar  amount for damages\nclaimed and in many of those cases that do specify a dollar amount, the specific\namount referred to is only the jurisdictional  minimum. In any event, the actual\ndamages paid out to claimants  pursuant to adverse judgments or settlements have\nhistorically  been only a small  fraction of the damages  claimed.  To date, our\nannual  payout on these  cases has not been  material.  However,  trends  toward\nlarger jury verdicts and increased  awards of punitive  damages  create the risk\nthat the amounts actually paid to asbestos claimants may increase in the future.\n\n                                       24\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n---------------------\n\n     General.   We  have  received  notices  under  various  federal  and  state\n     -------\nenvironmental laws that we (along with others) may be a potentially  responsible\nparty for the costs associated with  remediating  numerous  hazardous  substance\nstorage,  recycling or disposal sites in many states and, in some instances, for\nnatural  resource  damages.  We also  may have  been a  generator  of  hazardous\nsubstances  at a number of other sites.  The amount of any such costs or damages\nfor which we may be held responsible could be substantial. The contingent losses\nthat we expect to incur in connection with many of these sites have been accrued\nand those losses are  reflected in our financial  statements in accordance  with\ngenerally  accepted  accounting   principles.   However,  for  many  sites,  the\nremediation  costs and other damages for which we ultimately  may be responsible\nare not reasonably  estimable  because of uncertainties  with respect to factors\nsuch as our  connection to the site or to materials  there,  the  involvement of\nother  potentially  responsible  parties,  the  application  of laws  and  other\nstandards  or  regulations,  site  conditions,  and  the  nature  and  scope  of\ninvestigations,  studies,  and  remediation  to  be  undertaken  (including  the\ntechnologies  to  be  required  and  the  extent,   duration,   and  success  of\nremediation). As a result, we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the\namount of costs or other  damages for which we are  potentially  responsible  in\nconnection with these sites, although that total could be substantial.\n\n     Waste Disposal.  The EPA initiated a civil enforcement  action against Ford\n     --------------\nas a result of Ford  Venezuela's  1997  shipment of  industrial  wastes from its\nValencia  Assembly  Plant in  Venezuela  for disposal in Texas.  Ford  Venezuela\nshipped the  industrial  waste to the U.S. for disposal under the more stringent\nU.S. disposal  requirements  because of the  unavailability of adequate disposal\nfacilities  in Venezuela and to ensure  proper  disposal of the waste.  Although\nFord  believes that the subject  waste is properly  classified as  non-hazardous\nunder U.S.  environmental  laws, the EPA contends that even if the wastes do not\nexhibit any hazardous characteristics, they nevertheless may be the product of a\nprocess that is automatically deemed hazardous under applicable regulations.  If\nFord is determined to have  violated EPA  regulations  regarding the disposal of\nhazardous  wastes,  Ford  could be  required  to pay fines  which  could  exceed\n$100,000.\n\n     Ohio Assembly  Plant.  In September  1999, the EPA filed an  administrative\n     --------------------\ncomplaint  against Ford  alleging  violations of the Resource  Conservation  and\nRecovery Act (\"RCRA\") at Ford's Ohio Assembly Plant. The alleged  violations are\nrelated  to  Ford's  storage  of  hazardous  waste  and  the  absence  of a leak\nmonitoring program for paint equipment.  The count alleging failure to implement\na leak  monitoring  program for paint  equipment  remains  subject to discussion\nbetween Ford and EPA.  Subsequent to the Ohio Assembly  enforcement action, Ford\nhas received  notices of  violation  alleging  the same  noncompliance  at other\nfacilities.  If Ford is determined to have violated EPA regulations,  Ford could\nbe  required to pay fines or take other  actions,  the  aggregate  cost of which\ncould exceed $100,000.\n\n     Sale of E-450s in California. CARB has opened an investigation with respect\n     ----------------------------\nto approximately  375 1998 and 1999 model year E-450 vehicles sold to California\ncustomers.  CARB  alleges  that these  vehicles  were sold  without the required\nCalifornia  emissions  certification.  CARB  alleges that the sales were due, in\npart,  to an  error  in  Ford's  ordering  process  for  the  E-450.  If Ford is\ndetermined  to have  violated  CARB  regulations,  Ford could be required to pay\nfines that could exceed $100,000. Discussions between CARB and Ford are ongoing.\n\n\nClass Actions\n-------------\n\n     Paint Class Actions.  There are two purported class actions pending against\n     -------------------\nFord in Texas and Illinois  alleging claims for fraud,  breach of warranty,  and\nviolations of consumer  protection  statutes.  The Texas case purports to assert\nclaims  on behalf of Texas  residents  who have  experienced  paint  peeling  in\ncertain 1984 through 1992 model year Ford  vehicles.  The Illinois case purports\nto assert claims on behalf of residents of all states except Louisiana and Texas\nwho have  experienced  paint  peeling on most 1988  through 1997 model year Ford\nvehicles.  Plaintiffs  in both cases  contend that their paint is defective  and\nsusceptible  to  peeling  because  Ford did not use  spray  primer  between  the\nhigh-build  electrocoat  (\"HBEC\")  and the color coat.  The lack of spray primer\nallegedly causes the adhesion of the color coat to\n\n                                       25\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)\n\nthe HBEC to deteriorate  after extended  exposure to ultraviolet  radiation from\nsunlight.  Plaintiffs in both cases seek unspecified compensatory damages (in an\namount to cover the cost of  repainting  their  vehicles and to  compensate  for\nalleged diminution in value), punitive damages, attorneys' fees and interest.\n\n     The Illinois case, Phillips, is still in the early stages of litigation and\n                        --------\nthere have been no  significant  developments  in that case.  In the Texas case,\nSheldon, the trial court certified a class of Texas owners who experienced paint\n-------\npeeling because of the alleged defect.  On May 11, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court\nreversed  the trial  court,  decertified  the class  and  remanded  the case for\nfurther proceedings. On remand, the trial court certified two classes consisting\nof original owners of class vehicles who experienced  peeling paint and original\nowners who paid Ford or a Ford dealer to repaint their  vehicles.  We have filed\nan appeal with the Texas Court of Appeals.\n\n     TFI Module Class  Actions.  There are seven class actions  pending in state\n     -------------------------\ncourts in Alabama,  California,  Illinois,  Maryland,  Missouri,  Tennessee  and\nWashington,  alleging  defects in TFI  modules in more than 22 million  vehicles\nmanufactured  by Ford between 1983 and 1995.  With minor  variations  based upon\nstate law and differences in the scope of the classes alleged,  all of the cases\ninvolve  the same  legal  claims  and  theories.  The  parties  have  reached an\nagreement to settle the lead case in  California  and five of the other  pending\ncases. The agreement provides that Ford will extend the warranties applicable to\ndistributor-mounted  TFI modules to 100,000 miles,  reimburse  class members who\npreviously paid to replace Motorcraft(R) distributor-mounted TFI modules, donate\n$5  million to an  organization  for  research  and  education  in the fields of\nautomotive  safety or  environmental  protection,  and pay  plaintiffs'  counsel\nreasonable fees and expenses.  The court in the California case gave preliminary\napproval to the settlement. A final hearing on the settlement has been scheduled\nfor June 21, 2002. If the  settlement is approved by the California  court,  the\nremaining five cases expressly  subject to the settlement  will be dismissed.  A\nclass certification motion is pending in the seventh case (in Illinois),  but if\nthe  nationwide  settlement is approved by the  California  court we expect that\ncase to be dismissed as well.\n\n     Ford/Citibank  Visa Class Action.  Following the June 1997  announcement of\n     --------------------------------\nthe termination of the Ford/Citibank credit card rebate program,  five purported\nnationwide  class  actions and one purported  statewide  class action were filed\nagainst Ford; Citibank is also a defendant in some of these actions. The actions\nallege  damages in an amount up to $3,500  for each  cardholder  who  obtained a\nFord/Citibank credit card in reliance on the rebate program and who is precluded\nfrom  accumulating  discounts  toward the purchase or lease of new Ford vehicles\nafter  December  1997 as a result  of the  termination  of the  rebate  program.\nPlaintiffs  contend  that  defendants  deceptively  breached  their  contract by\nunilaterally  terminating  the  program,  that  defendants  have  been  unjustly\nenriched  as  a  result  of  the  interest   charges  and  fees  collected  from\ncardholders, and further, that defendants conspired to deprive plaintiffs of the\nbenefits of their credit card agreement.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory  damages,\nor  alternatively,  reinstatement of the rebate program,  and punitive  damages,\ncosts, expenses and attorneys' fees. The five purported nationwide class actions\nwere  filed  in  state  courts  in  Alabama,  Illinois,  New  York,  Oregon  and\nWashington,  and the purported  statewide class action was filed in a California\nstate court. The Alabama court has conditionally certified a class consisting of\nAlabama  residents.  Ford  removed  all of the  cases to  federal  court,  which\nconsolidated  and  transferred  the cases to  federal  court in  Washington  for\npretrial  proceedings.   In  October  1999,  the  federal  court  dismissed  the\nconsolidated  proceedings for lack of jurisdiction  and sent each action back to\nthe state court in which it  originated.  We appealed  this ruling to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth  Circuit,  which affirmed the trial court.\nThe United  States  Supreme  Court has  granted  Ford's  petition  for a writ of\ncertiorari and will review the decision of the Ninth Circuit. We do not expect a\ndecision from the Court until at least the fourth quarter.\n\n     Lease  Residual  Class Action.  In January 1998, in connection  with a case\n     -----------------------------\npending in Illinois state court, Ford and Ford Credit were served with a summons\nand  intervention  counterclaim  complaint  relating  to Ford  Credit's  leasing\npractices  (Higginbotham  v. Ford Credit).  The  counterclaim  plaintiff,  Carla\n            ----------------------------\nHigginbotham,  is a member of a class that has been conditionally  certified for\nsettlement  purposes in Shore v. Ford  Credit.  In the Shore  case,  Ford Credit\n                        ---------------------          -----\ncommenced an action for deficiency against Virginia Shore, a Ford Credit lessee.\nShore  counterclaimed  for  purported  violations  of the  Truth-in-Leasing  Act\n(alleging that\n\n                                       26\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)\n\ncertain lease charges were  excessive)  and the  Truth-in-Lending  Act (alleging\nthat the lease  lacked  clarity).  Shore  purported  to represent a class of all\nsimilarly situated lessees. Ford was not a party to the Shore case. Higginbotham\n                                                        -----\nobjected to the proposed  settlement  of the Shore case,  intervened  as a named\n                                             -----\ndefendant,  filed separate counterclaims against Ford Credit, and joined Ford as\nan additional counterclaim  defendant.  Higginbotham asserts claims against Ford\nCredit for violations of the Consumer Leasing Act, seeks a declaratory  judgment\nconcerning the  enforceability of early termination  provisions in Ford Credit's\nleases, and asserts fraud. She also asserts a claim against Ford Credit and Ford\nfor   conspiracy  to  violate  the   Truth-in-Lending   Act.  The   Higginbotham\n                                                                    ------------\ncounterclaims allege that Ford Credit inflates the residual values of its leased\nvehicles,  which results in lower monthly lease payments but higher  termination\nfees for lessees who  exercise  their right of early  termination.  Higginbotham\nclaims that the early  termination  fees were not  adequately  disclosed  on the\nlease form and that the fees are excessive and illegal  because of the allegedly\ninflated  residual  values.  She also  alleges  that Ford  dictated the residual\nvalues to Ford Credit and thereby participated in an unlawful  conspiracy.  This\ncase was stayed pending the  approval/rejection of the settlement in Shore. Ford\n                                                                     -----\nCredit has reached individual settlements with the Shore plaintiffs.\n                                                   -----\n\n     The Illinois court in Higginbotham  found that the lease end residual value\n                           ------------\nof Ms.  Higginbotham's  vehicle  was  properly  valued  and,  as a  result,  Ms.\nHigginbotham was an inadequate representative for the class.  Subsequently,  Ms.\nHigginbotham   voluntarily  dismissed  her  intervention   counterclaim  without\nprejudice in the Illinois  state court and has  reactivated  her initial suit in\nthe Florida federal court,  pursuing  substantially  similar claims on behalf of\nherself and others similarly  situated.  Consequently,  the Higginbotham case is\n                                                            ------------\nproceeding  in  Florida.  In  addition,  Ford  Credit  has filed a  response  to\nplaintiff's  motion  for class  certification  and has  renewed  its  motion for\nsummary judgment based on information obtained in discovery.\n\n     Retail Lessee Insurance  Coverage Class Action.  On May 24, 1999,  Michigan\n     ----------------------------------------------\nMutual  Insurance  Company was served with a purported class action complaint in\nfederal court in Florida  alleging that the Ford Commercial,  General  Liability\nand Business  Automobile  Insurance Policy,  and the Personal Auto Supplement to\nthat  policy,  provides  uninsured/underinsured  motorist  coverage  and medical\npayments  coverage  to retail  lessees  of Ford  vehicles  (e.g.,  to Red Carpet\nlessees).  The Company is required to defend and indemnify  Michigan Mutual. The\ncomplaint  rests on an untenable  interpretation  of the Michigan Mutual policy,\nwhich  was  intended  to cover  company  cars  and  lease  evaluation  vehicles.\nUnfortunately,  however,  the Florida Court of Appeals in a prior action brought\nby a single individual,  has accepted plaintiffs'  interpretation of the policy.\nThe Florida court's opinion should not be controlling in federal court, however,\nand Ford has filed a motion for summary  judgment  based on the policy  language\nand the  intention  of the  parties.  Plaintiffs  responded  to  Ford's  motion,\ncross-moved for summary judgment in their favor, moved to amend their complaint,\nand moved for  class  certification.  A  hearing  on Ford's  motion  was held on\nOctober 2, 2000, and we expect a decision sometime in 2002.\n\n         Throttle Body Assemblies Class Action. A purported nationwide class\n         -------------------------------------\naction is pending in federal court in Ohio on behalf of all persons who own or\nlease 1999 Mercury Villagers. The complaint alleges that the vehicle has a\ndefective throttle body assembly that causes the gas pedal to intermittently\nlock or stick in the closed position. The complaint alleges breach of warranty,\nnegligence, and violation of consumer protection statutes. Plaintiffs seek an\norder requiring Ford to recall the vehicles. They also seek unspecified\ncompensatory damages, treble damages, attorneys fees, and costs. Plaintiffs'\nmotion to certify a class is pending.\n\n     Windstar  Transmission  Class  Actions.  Two  purported  class  actions are\n--------------------------------------\npending,  alleging  that  Ford  marketed,  advertised,  sold,  and  leased  1995\nWindstars in a deceptive manner by misrepresenting  their quality and safety and\nactively  concealing  defects  in the  transmissions.  One  case is  pending  in\nCalifornia  state  court and is  limited to owners  and  lessees of that  state.\nAnother case is pending in Illinois state court and purports to represent owners\nand lessees  from all  states.  Plaintiffs  contend  that  transmissions  in the\nWindstar  have  prematurely  suffered from  shifting  problems and  acceleration\nfailures,  requiring  early  replacement at substantial  expense to owners.  The\ncases assert several  statutory and common law theories,  and seek several types\nof relief,  including unspecified  compensatory  damages,  punitive damages, and\ninjunctive  relief.  Plaintiffs' have filed a motion for class  certification in\nthe California case. (A third case, which alleged a defect in the  transmissions\nof 3.8 liter engines in 1990-95\n\n                                       27\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 3.

Four purported statewide class actions were filed\n     -----------------------\nin state  courts in  Maryland,  New  Hampshire,  New Jersey and New York against\nFord, General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler AG alleging that seat backs\nwith single recliner mechanisms are defective. Plaintiffs in each of these suits\nalleged that seats installed in class vehicles  (defined as almost all passenger\ncars made after  1991) are  defective  because the seat backs are  unstable  and\nsusceptible  to  rearward  collapse  in the event of a rear-end  collision.  The\npurported  class in each state  consists of all persons who own a class  vehicle\nand  specifically  excludes all persons who have suffered  personal  injury as a\nresult of the rearward  collapse of a seat.  Plaintiffs  allege causes of action\nfor negligence, strict liability, implied warranty, fraud, and civil conspiracy.\nPlaintiffs  also allege  violations of the consumer  protection  statutes in the\nvarious states.  Plaintiffs seek  \"compensatory  damages measured by the cost of\ncorrecting  the defect,  not to exceed  $5,000 for each class  vehicle.\"  Ford's\nmotions to dismiss were granted in Maryland,  New  Hampshire,  and New York, and\nFord's motion for summary judgment was granted in New Jersey.  The New Hampshire\nSupreme Court affirmed the trial court's  ruling,  but  plaintiffs'  appeals are\npending in New York, Maryland, and New Jersey.\n\n     Late Charges Class Actions.  A purported  state-wide class action was filed\n     --------------------------\nin state court in Maryland (Simpkins v. Ford Credit) in which the plaintiffs are\n                            -----------------------\ncontending  that Ford Motor  Credit  Company's  late  charges on lease  accounts\nviolate state law. The  plaintiffs  allege that Ford Credit and PRIMUS  violated\nthe Maryland  Consumer  Leasing Act, the Maryland  Constitution and the Maryland\nConsumer Code by charging late fees in consumer lease  transactions in excess of\n6%. The  plaintiffs  assert that the maximum late fee allowed under Maryland law\nis the judgment rate of interest,  which is 6% per annum. Plaintiffs are seeking\nrestitution,  punitive damages and injunctive  relief. We have filed a motion to\ndismiss.\n\n     Fair Lending Class Action. Ford Credit has been served with three purported\n     -------------------------\nclass actions alleging that its pricing practices are discriminatory. One (Jones\n                                                                           -----\nv.

The Jones case alleges that\n------                                                   -----\nour pricing  practices  discriminate  against African  Americans.  Specifically,\nplaintiffs  allege that  although  Ford  Credit's  initial  credit risk  scoring\nanalysis applies  objective  criteria to calculate the risk-related  \"Buy Rate,\"\nFord Credit then  authorizes  dealers to impose a  subjective  component  in its\ncredit  pricing  system - the  Mark-up  Policy - to impose  additional  non-risk\ncharges.   It  is  the  alleged   subjective   mark-up  that  plaintiffs  allege\ndiscriminates  against  African  Americans.  Ford Credit's motion to dismiss was\ndenied and the parties are  preparing for trial.  Rodriquez  and Lucena  involve\n                                                  ---------      ------\nsimilar  allegations but with respect to Hispanic Americans.  In Rodriquez,  the\n                                                                 ---------\ncourt denied our motion to dismiss and we expect the plaintiffs to file a motion\nfor class certification. In Lucena, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily\n                            ------\ndismiss the case without prejudice,  which was granted. We expect the plaintiffs\nto re-file the case.  Ford and Ford Credit  believe that Ford  Credit's  pricing\npractices are fair and are not discriminatory.\n\n     F-150  Radiator  Class  Actions.  Two  purported  class actions are pending\n     -------------------------------\nalleging  that the Company  defrauded  purchasers  of 1999-2001  F-150 trucks by\nfalsely representing that certain option packages included \"upgraded\" radiators.\nApproximately  400,000  trucks that were intended to have larger  radiators were\nbuilt with standard radiators. The first case, filed in state court in New York,\npurports  to  represent  a  nationwide  class,  and  seeks  an  order  requiring\ninstallation of larger radiators and other damages.  The trial court granted our\nmotion to dismiss,  and plaintiffs have appealed.  In the second case,  filed in\nstate court in Texas, the trial court has certified a class of all purchasers of\n2000 and 2001 F-150  trucks with heavy duty or trailer  packages  in Texas,  and\nseeks  unspecified  damages.  We are appealing that ruling to the Texas Court of\nAppeals. Plaintiffs' motion to modify the certification ruling to expand it to a\nnationwide class is pending in the trial court.\n\n                                       28\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)\n\n     Platinum  Group Metals. A purported  nationwide class action has been filed\n     ----------------------\nagainst the Company in federal court in New York alleging  securities  fraud and\nviolations  of Rule  10b-5 on behalf of all  persons  who  purchased  Ford stock\nbetween  December  1, 1999 and  January  12,  2002  (the  \"class  period\").  The\nplaintiff alleges that during the class period the Company entered into a series\nof contracts for the purchase of platinum group metals  (\"PGM\") at  historically\nhigh prices and failed to properly hedge these  purchases,  thereby exposing the\nCompany to losses  when the price of PGM fell.  The  plaintiffs  allege that the\nCompany  made  statements  in its  securities  disclosures  about its  commodity\npurchase  practices  and hedging  programs  that misled  investors  as to Ford's\nexposure to loss from PGM purchases.  As a result,  plaintiffs  allege that they\npurchased Ford stock at inflated prices and were damaged when Ford  \"wrote-down\"\nthe value of its PGM by $1 billion on a pre-tax basis.\n\n     Side Release Seat Belt Buckles.  On February 14, 2002, Ford was served with\n     ------------------------------\na purported  class action  alleging that the side release  buckles  installed in\n1969 through 1998 Ford vehicles are defective  because they \"could  unlatch from\ninertial  forces.\" The suit was filed in state court in Illinois against General\nMotors Corporation as well as against Ford,  allegedly on behalf of all Illinois\nowners of vehicles with the defective buckles.  The complaint seeks compensatory\nand  punitive  damages,  including a payment to each class member of the cost of\ninstalling different buckles.\n\n\nOther Matters\n-------------\n\n     Rouge Powerhouse Insurance  Litigation.  There are several pending lawsuits\n     --------------------------------------\narising out of the February 1, 1999 Rouge  Powerhouse  explosion.  In June 2000,\nFord filed a coverage  action against ten property  insurance  carriers  seeking\nproperty damage and business  interruption losses attributable to the Powerhouse\nexplosion.  Factory Mutual,  one of these insurers,  filed a counterclaim in the\nlawsuit for claims paid to Rouge Steel Company (\"Rouge Steel\"). Factory Mutual's\ncounterclaim  alleges that Rouge Steel's damages  occurred as a result of Ford's\nnegligence,  gross negligence or willful and wanton  misconduct in operating the\nPowerhouse  and totals  approximately  $340 million.  This  counterclaim,  and a\nsimilar claim for  approximately  $25 million by other  insurers of Rouge Steel,\nhas been  ordered to  arbitration.  Additionally,  claims  related  to  business\ninterruption  losses  incurred by several  suppliers  to Rouge  Steel,  totaling\napproximately $20 million, also have been added to the arbitration. In addition,\nseventeen Ford employees and two Rouge Steel  employees also have filed lawsuits\nseeking  recovery  in  excess  of $100  million  in the  aggregate  for  alleged\npsychological injuries caused as a result of the explosion.\n\n     Visteon Dispute.  As reported in the media,  Ford and Visteon  Corporation,\n     ---------------\nour former automotive  components subsidiary that was spun-off on June 28, 2000,\nhave been attempting to resolve certain  disputes that arose out of the spin-off\nrelated to the  pricing of  components  sold by  Visteon  to Ford.  The  primary\ndisputes  related  to (i)  the  amount  of  Ford's  contractual  entitlement  to\nproductivity  price  reductions  for the year 2001,  and (ii) Ford's  ability to\nadjust  downward the price of business  sourced to Visteon in Europe at the time\nof the spin-off over the years 2001-2005. We have negotiated a resolution of the\nfirst matter in respect of North America, and Visteon is pursuing arbitration of\nthe second matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem 4.

These shares were sold\nin  several,   unrelated  transactions  to  owners  of  automotive  dealerships,\nautomotive  recycling  businesses,  and other  businesses  in exchange for those\nbusinesses. The consideration we received for the shares was equal to the market\nvalue of the  shares at the time of the  transactions.  No shares of our  Common\nStock were sold in 2001 in such private transactions.\n\n                                       35\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\nItem 6.

Adjusted for constant volume\nand mix and excluding  unusual  items and costs  related to our  Firestone  tire\nreplacement  action,  our total costs in the  Automotive  sector  increased $1.0\nbillion compared with 2000.\n\n     Our Automotive  sector losses from  continuing  operations in North America\nwere $5,597 million in 2001 on sales of $91.0 billion, compared with earnings of\n$4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9  billion.  The earnings  deterioration\nreflected  primarily  lower vehicle unit sales volumes,  the charges  associated\nwith the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly\nincreased  marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement\naction  and  increased   warranty  and  other  costs  associated  with  customer\nsatisfaction initiatives.\n\n                                       43\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations (Continued)\n\n     In 2001,  approximately  17.5  million new cars and trucks were sold in the\nUnited  States,  down from 17.8 million  units in 2000.  Our share of those unit\nsales  was  22.8% in 2001,  down 0.9  percentage  points  from a year  ago,  due\nprimarily to increased  competition  resulting  from new model entrants into the\ntruck and sport utility vehicle segments,  as well as the continued  weakness of\nthe Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese\ncompetitors.  Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased\nto  14.7%  of  sales  of those  brands,  up from  11.1% a year  ago,  reflecting\nincreased  competitive  pricing in the form of subsidized  financing and leasing\nprograms (such as 0.0% financing  during the fourth  quarter),  cash rebates and\nother incentive programs.\n\n     Our Automotive  sector earnings in Europe were $266 million from continuing\noperations  in 2001,  compared  with  losses of $1,130  million a year ago.  The\nincrease  reflected  the  non-recurrence  of the 2000  charge  related  to asset\nimpairments and  restructuring,  as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the\neffect on  depreciation  from last year's  asset  impairment  and  restructuring\nactions.\n\n     In 2001,  approximately  17.8  million new cars and trucks were sold in our\nnineteen  primary  European  markets,  down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our\nshare of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001,  up 0.7  percentage  points  from a\nyear ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford-brand Mondeo and Transit models\nand our acquisition of Land Rover.\n\n     Our  Automotive  sector  losses in South  America  were $777  million  from\ncontinuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $240 million in 2000. The\ndecrease is more than explained by asset impairment  charges and the devaluation\nof the Argentine peso.\n\n     Industry sales in 2001 were 1.6 million units in Brazil,  up about 10% from\n2000, and approximately 201,000 units in Argentina, down 41% from 2000. Brazil's\neconomy has  recently  entered  into a recession as a result of tight fiscal and\nmonetary policies and election year uncertainties, which have restrained growth.\nWe expect industry volumes in Brazil to deteriorate in 2002. Economic conditions\ncontinue to remain weak in  Argentina  primarily  as a result of the recent peso\ndevaluation.  Our combined  car and truck market share in these  markets in 2001\nwas 7.8% in Brazil (down 1.3 percentage points) and 14.3% in Argentina (down 1.4\npercentage points).\n\n     Automotive sector losses from continuing  operations outside North America,\nEurope, and South America (\"Rest of World\") were $159 million in 2001,  compared\nwith  earnings of $108  million in 2000.  The earnings  deterioration  reflected\nFord's share of a non-cash charge relating to Mazda's pension expenses and other\nrestructuring actions at Mazda.\n\n     New car and truck sales in Australia,  our largest market in Rest of World,\nwere  approximately  773,000 units in 2001,  down about 14,000 units from a year\nago. In 2001,  our combined  car and truck market share in Australia  was 15.1%,\ndown 0.6 percentage points from 2000,  reflecting  primarily share deterioration\nin the full-size car segment due to continued aggressive competition.\n\n2000 Compared with 1999\n-----------------------\n\n     Worldwide  earnings from  continuing  operations for our Automotive  sector\nwere  $3,624  million in 2000 on sales of $141  billion,  compared  with  $4,986\nmillion in 1999 on sales of $135  billion.  The  decrease in earnings  reflected\nasset  impairments  and  restructuring  charges in Europe and lower  earnings in\nNorth America,  offset partially by improved results in South America.  Adjusted\nfor constant  volume and mix, our total costs in the Automotive  sector declined\n$500 million compared with 1999.\n\n     Our Automotive sector earnings from continuing  operations in North America\nwere $4,886  million in 2000 on sales of $103.9  billion,  compared  with $5,418\nmillion in 1999 on sales of $99.2 billion. The earnings deterioration  reflected\nprimarily  costs  associated  with the Firestone tire recall and higher warranty\ncosts related to our 3.8 liter engine, offset partially by increased volume. The\nafter-tax return on sales for our Automotive sector in North America was 4.8% in\n2000, down 0.7 percentage points from 1999.\n\n                                       44\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations (Continued)\n\n     In 2000,  approximately  17.8  million new cars and trucks were sold in the\nUnited States, up from 17.4 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales\nwas 23.7% in 2000, down 0.1 percentage points from 1999.\n\n     Our Automotive  sector losses in Europe were $1,130 million from continuing\noperations  in 2000,  compared  with  earnings  of $50  million a year ago.  The\ndecline  reflected  primarily the second  quarter 2000 charge of $1,019  million\nrelated to asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations.\n\n     In 2000,  approximately  17.9  million new cars and trucks were sold in our\nnineteen  primary  European  markets,  down from 18.2 million units in 1999. Our\nshare of those unit sales was 10% in 2000, down 0.2 percentage points from 1999,\nreflecting  primarily an increase in market share related to our acquisitions of\nVolvo Car and Land Rover,  offset by a decrease in market  share for  Ford-brand\nvehicles.  The decrease in our Ford brand share  reflected  primarily  continued\naggressive competition.\n\n     Our  Automotive  sector in South America lost $240 million from  continuing\noperations  in  2000,  compared  with  a loss  of  $444  million  in  1999.  The\nimprovement  reflected  primarily  higher  vehicle  margins  resulting from cost\nreductions and improved product mix and pricing.\n\n     In 2000, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil,\ncompared  with 1.3  million  in 1999.  Our share of those unit sales was 9.1% in\n2000,  down 0.6  percentage  points  from  1999.  The  decline  in market  share\nreflected increased competition.\n\n     Automotive sector earnings from continuing  operations in the Rest of World\nwere $108 million in 2000, compared with earnings of $87 million in 1999.\n\n     New car and truck sales in Australia,  our largest market in Rest of World,\nwere approximately  788,000 units in 2000,  essentially  unchanged from 1999. In\n2000, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.7%,  down 1.9\npercentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures.\n\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n     Earnings  of  our  Financial  Services  sector  consist  primarily  of  two\nsegments,  Ford  Credit and  Hertz.

Interest-only  strips,  also  referred to as\nexcess  spread,  represent  Ford Credit's  right to receive  collections on sold\nreceivables  in  excess  of the  amount  needed to pay  principal  and  interest\npayments to investors and servicing fees.\n\n     Gains or losses on sales of  receivables  are  recognized  in the period in\nwhich they are sold.  As shown  above,  in 2001 such  gains  were $412  million,\ncompared  with $14 million and $83 million in 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The\nsale of receivables has the impact of reducing Ford Credit's  financing  margins\nin the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years.  The net impact\nof securitizations on Ford Credit's earnings in a given year will vary depending\non the amount,  type of receivable and timing of  securitizations in the current\nyear and the  preceding  two to three year period,  as well as the interest rate\nenvironments   at  the  time  the  finance   receivables   were  originated  and\nsecuritized.

This was down\n$1.0  billion  from  2000,  reflecting  primarily  a reduced  number of  product\nintroductions.  Capital  expenditures  were  4.8% of  sales  in  2001,  down 0.4\npercentage points from a year ago.\n\n     The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily\nlower  receivables  ($2.2  billion in 2001  compared with $4.7 billion in 2000),\nresulting  largely from  implementation of Ford's best practices for receivables\nmanagement  (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory  improvements  across\nmuch of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000).\n\n     Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001.\nHowever,  no  dividend  payments  were  made  in the  fourth  quarter  of  2001.\nAdditionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to\nFord Credit as additional  equity,  which  lowered Ford Credit's  debt-to-equity\nratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from  securitized\nfunding as debt).\n\n     In  2001,  we spent  $2.0  billion  for  acquisitions  of  other  companies\n(primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our  acquisition of\nVolvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the\npurchase of the  minority  interest  in Hertz.  These  expenditures  were offset\npartially  by  divestitures  (primarily  proceeds of about $400 million from the\nsale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture).\n\n                                       48\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations (Continued)\n\n     In 2001,  we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our\n$5 billion share repurchase  program ($1.2 billion) and our anti-dilutive  share\nrepurchase  program.  Issuances  of common stock in 2001,  reflecting  primarily\nemployee  stock  option  exercises,  resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500\nmillion.\n\n     Debt and Net Cash - At December 31, 2001, our  Automotive  sector had total\n     -----------------\ndebt of $13.8  billion,  up $1.7 billion  from a year ago. The weighted  average\nmaturity of this debt is  approximately  28 years, of which $902 million matures\nby December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our  Automotive  sector had net cash\n(defined  as gross  cash less total of  long-term  debt and  current  portion of\nlong-term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at\nthe end of 2000 and 1999, respectively.\n\n     Credit  Facilities - At December 31, 2001, the  Automotive  sector had $8.6\n     ------------------\nbillion of contractually  committed credit agreements with various banks;  87.4%\nof this amount is available  through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to\ntransfer,  on a  non-guaranteed  basis,  $7.4  billion and $598 million of these\ncredit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively.\n\n     Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities - On January 30, 2002, we\n     -------------------------------------------------\nsold 100 million shares of Cumulative  Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to\nthe public at a price of $50 per share,  for net  proceeds  (after  underwriting\ncommissions,  but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000.  The proceeds will be used\nfor general  corporate  purposes.  The preferred  securities were issued by Ford\nMotor  Company  Capital  Trust  II,  the sole  assets  of which  are the  junior\nsubordinated  convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company.\nThe preferred  securities  can be converted  into shares of Ford common stock at\nany time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted,  the aggregate\namount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would\nbe about 282 million shares.\n\n\nFinancial Services Sector\n-------------------------\n\n     Ford Credit\n\n     Debt and Cash - Ford Credit's total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31,\n     -------------\n2001,  equal to last year.  Outstanding  commercial  paper at December  31, 2001\ntotaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit,  with an average remaining  maturity of 48\ndays. At December 31, 2001,  Ford Credit had cash and cash  equivalents  of $2.9\nbillion.  In the  normal  course of its  funding  activities,  Ford  Credit  may\ngenerate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate  funding needs. This\nexcess funding is referred to as  \"overborrowings.\"  Of the $2.9 billion of cash\nand cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings.\n\n     Funding - Ford Credit requires  substantial funding in the normal course of\n     -------\nbusiness.  Ford Credit's  funding  requirements are driven mainly by the need to\n(i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the\nsale of Ford products,  which to a large extent are influenced by Ford-sponsored\nspecial  financing and leasing programs that are available  exclusively  through\nFord Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations.\n\n     Funding  sources for Ford  Credit  include  the sale of  commercial  paper,\nissuance of term debt, the sale of  receivables  and, in the case of Ford Credit\nEurope,  the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various\nmarkets.\n\n     Ford  Credit's  commercial  paper  issuances  are  used to meet  short-term\nfunding needs.  Ford Credit has commercial  paper programs in the United States,\nEurope,  Canada and other  international  markets.  It reduced the amount of its\noutstanding  global  commercial  paper from $42.3  billion at the end of 2000 to\n$15.7  billion  ($13.8  billion net of  overborrowings)  at December 31, 2001 by\nreplacing such funding with term-debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables.\nDuring 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial  paper  outstanding at\nlevels of around $5 billion to $7 billion,  net of  overborrowings.  Ford Credit\nalso obtains short-term  funding through the issuance of variable\n\n                                       49\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations (Continued)\n\ndenomination,  floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market  Account\nprogram. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank\nborrowings  by Ford Credit's  foreign  affiliates  are an  additional  source of\nshort-term funding.\n\n     Long-term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance\nof a variety  of debt  securities  underwritten  in both the  United  States and\ninternational  capital  markets.  During 2001, Ford Credit issued  approximately\n$40.3 billion of term-debt  with  maturities  of two to ten years.  During 2002,\nFord  Credit  plans to raise  $15  billion  to $20  billion  through  term  debt\nissuances  and $15 billion to $20 billion  through  securitization  transactions\n(excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper\nprograms),  which are  discussed  below.  Other  sources of funds  include  bank\nborrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive.\n\n     Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding  strategy to reduce its\nreliance on short-term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance\nreceivables in  securitization  transactions  because of its lower relative cost\n(as described  below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured  long-term debt to\nimprove its liquidity.  Ford Credit will continue to use  securitization as long\nas it  provides  added  funding  and remains  cost  efficient.  Ford Credit also\ndeveloped  additional  funding  sources and  capacity to maintain a  diversified\nfunding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset-backed\ncommercial paper programs.\n\n     As a result of this  funding  strategy,  the decline in debt  ratings  Ford\nCredit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty\nto fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial\npaper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credit's funding strategy will continue\nto focus on  improving  liquidity  and making  diverse and  competitive  funding\nsources available.  We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit\nto  maintain  liquidity  through  difficult  economic  conditions.  Any  further\nlowering of Ford Credit's debt ratings  would  increase its borrowing  costs and\npotentially  constrain  certain funding  availability  from the capital markets.\nThis in turn  likely  would  cause Ford  Credit to rely more  heavily on funding\nthrough   securitization   transactions.   However,  Ford  Credit's  ability  to\nsecuritize its receivables may be affected by the following factors:  the amount\nand  credit  quality  of  receivables  available  to sell,  the  performance  of\nreceivables  sold in  previous  transactions,  general  demand  for the  type of\nreceivables Ford Credit offers,  and Ford Credit's debt ratings.  If as a result\nof any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding  significantly\nincreased or  securitized  funding was no longer  available to Ford Credit,  its\nliquidity would be adversely impacted.\n\n     The cost of both  unsecured  term debt and funding  through  securitization\ntransactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark  interest rate,\nsuch as the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  or  interest  rates  paid on U.S.\nTreasury Notes of similar  maturities.  Spreads are typically  measured in basis\npoints,  where one basis point equals one  one-hundredth of one percent (0.01%).\nThe   relative   stability  of  spreads  for  funding   through   securitization\ntransactions   compared   with   unsecured   term-debt   funding   spreads   and\ndiversification   of  funding  sources  are  the  primary  reasons  Ford  Credit\nsecuritizes  assets as a funding  source.  Since 1998,  the fixed rate spread on\nFord  Credit's  securitized  funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis\npoints above  comparable  U.S.  Treasury  rates,  while Ford Credit's  unsecured\nterm-debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over\n264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates.\n\n     Over  the  last  year,  Ford  Credit  significantly  increased  its  use of\nsecuritization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more\ncost-effective  source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000\nand 1999, Ford Credit's proceeds from the sale of finance  receivables are shown\nbelow (in billions):\n\n                   Receivable Type                  2001      2000     1999\n                   ---------------                --------- --------- --------\n                   Retail                         $32.0     $19.2      $8.7\n                   Wholesale                        8.8       0.3       1.2\n                                                  -----     -----      ----\n                        Net Proceeds...           $40.8     $19.5      $9.9\n                                                  =====     =====      ====\n\n     In addition,  in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables  resulting in\n$9.6 billion of proceeds.\n\n                                       50\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations (Continued)\n\n     For additional  liquidity,  Ford Credit maintains  contractually  committed\ncredit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December\n31, 2001,  including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority\nof these  facilities  are available  through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in\nuse at December 31, 2001  (primarily by affiliates  outside of the United States\nand  Europe).  In  addition,  Ford Credit and Ford  Credit  Europe may at Ford's\noption use $7.4  billion and $598  million,  respectively,  of Ford's  committed\ncredit  facilities,  which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December\n31,  2001,  banks also  provided  $12.5  billion of  facilities  to support Ford\nCredit's asset-backed commercial paper program.\n\n     Ford Credit also has entered into agreements  with several  bank-sponsored,\ncommercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to\npurchase from Ford Credit,  at Ford Credit's option, up to an aggregate of $12.4\nbillion of receivables.  These  agreements  have varying  maturity dates between\nJune 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6\nbillion of these commitments were utilized.\n\n     Special Purpose  Entities - Ford Credit  regularly uses  securitization  to\n     -------------------------\nfinance  its  operations.  Ford  Credit  securitizes  retail  installment  sales\ncontracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from\nFord-franchised  dealers and non-Ford dealers representing loans used to finance\ntheir  automobile  floorplan  inventories,  generally  referred to as  wholesale\nreceivables  or  floorplan  receivables.  Ford  Credit  occasionally  engages in\nsecuritization of operating leases.\n\n     In  a  typical  securitization,   Ford  Credit  sells  a  pool  of  finance\nreceivables to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary that\nestablishes  a  separate   special  purpose  trust  (\"SPE\")  and  transfers  the\nreceivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued\nby the trust.  Following  the transfer of the sold  receivables  to the SPE, the\nreceivables  are no longer  assets of Ford  Credit and the sold  receivables  no\nlonger appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest-bearing  securities,\nusually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates,  secured\nby future  collections on the sold  receivables  and related  collateral.  These\nsecurities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities, are structured into\nsenior and  subordinate  classes.  The senior  classes  have  priority  over the\nsubordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also\nbenefit from other  enhancements such as over  collateralization,  excess spread\nand cash reserve  funds.  These  securities  generally are rated by at least two\nindependent  rating  agencies  and sold in  registered  public  offerings  or in\nprivate transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws.\n\n     Ford Credit uses SPEs in  securitization  transactions to achieve,  for the\nbenefit of securitization  investors,  isolation of the sold receivables so that\nthe  receivables  securing the securities  issued by the SPE would be beyond the\nreach of Ford Credit's creditors.  The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to\nissue highly-rated  securities in a highly-liquid and efficient market,  thereby\nproviding Ford Credit with a  cost-effective  source of funding.  The two-tiered\nsale  of  receivables  to a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  and  then  to the  SPE is\nconventional in the asset backed  securitization  market. Most of these SPEs are\nclassified  as  qualifying   special  purpose   entities   consistent  with  the\nrequirements  of SFAS  No.  140,  Accounting  for  Transfers  and  Servicing  of\nFinancial Assets and  Extinguishments  of Liabilities,  because of the nature of\nthe assets held by these  entities and the limited  nature of their  activities.\nNone of our or Ford Credit's  officers,  directors or employees holds any equity\ninterest in the SPEs or receives  any direct or indirect  compensation  from the\nSPEs.  The SPEs do not own stock in either  Ford or Ford  Credit or any of their\naffiliates.\n\n     Ford  Credit  or  its  affiliates   often  retain  interests  in  the  sold\nreceivables.   The  retained  interests  may  include  senior  and  subordinated\nsecurities,  restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and  interest-only\nstrips.  Subordinated  securities  represent  lower rated  classes of securities\nissued by the SPEs.  Restricted  cash is funded  initially by a small portion of\nproceeds  from the sale of  receivables  that may be used to pay  principal  and\ninterest to SPE investors,  with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after\ninvestors  are fully  paid.  Interest-only  strips,  also  referred to as excess\nspread,  represent  the  right  to  receive  collections  on  the  sold  finance\nreceivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal\nto  investors  and  servicing  fees.  The  retained  interests  serve as  credit\nenhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs.\n\n                                       51\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations (Continued)\n\n     At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total  outstanding  principal  amount of\nreceivables  sold by Ford  Credit  that was held by SPEs was $58.7  billion  and\n$28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credit's retained interests in\nsuch sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.\n\n     Ford  Credit has no  obligation  to  repurchase  any sold  receivable  that\nbecomes  delinquent  in payment or otherwise  is in default.  The holders of the\nasset-backed  securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for\ncredit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit\nto repurchase  their  securities.  Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities\nissued  by  SPEs.  However,  as  is  customary  in  asset-backed  securitization\ntransactions,  Ford Credit as the seller of the finance  receivables to the SPE,\nis obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall\ninto three basic categories:\n\n     Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches\nof  representations  and  warranties  made  at  the  time  the  receivables  are\noriginally  transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities  incurred by the\ntrust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE.\n\n     Receivable repurchase obligations.  The rating agencies specify eligibility\ncriteria  for  receivables  permitted  to be included in  securitizations.  Ford\nCredit makes  representations  and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables\nmeet the eligibility  criteria.  If a breach of any of our  representations  and\nwarranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later  discovered,  the\nSPE may require us to repurchase the non-conforming receivable from the SPE. The\nrepurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest.\n\n     Mandatory sale of additional receivables.  Ford Credit uses both amortizing\nand revolving structures in its securitizations.  In most amortizing structures,\nthe SPE issues  securities that will receive  monthly  payments of principal and\ninterest and therefore amortize down as principal  collections are received.  In\nrevolving  structures,  the SPE  issues  securities  that only  receive  monthly\ninterest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period,  before\nreceiving  repayments of principal.  Because the principal  amount of the issued\nsecurities  remains  constant  during the  revolving  period while the principal\nbalance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the\nsponsor of the securitization  transaction, is required to replenish or \"top up\"\nthe SPE with new  receivables,  which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from\nprincipal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period.\n\n     In  addition,  in  connection  with  securitization  transactions,  the SPE\nengages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold  receivables for a servicing\nfee of 1% of the principal  amount of the  receivables.  As servicer of the sold\nreceivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to\nobligors if such  extensions and  adjustments  are consistent with our servicing\npolicies and  procedures.  However,  if Ford Credit makes material  changes to a\nreceivable,  including  changes to the interest  rate,  changes in the amount or\nnumber of  monthly  payments  or  extensions  of the final  payment  date of any\nreceivable  beyond  certain  established  dates,  Ford  Credit  is  required  to\nrepurchase  the  affected  receivable  from the SPE at face value  plus  accrued\ninterest.\n\n\n     Hertz\n\n     Hertz requires  funding for the acquisition of revenue  earning  equipment,\nwhich  consists of vehicles and  industrial and  construction  equipment.  Hertz\npurchases this equipment in accordance  with the terms of agreements  negotiated\nwith automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz\nare seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry.\nHertz's fleet size, and its related  financing  requirements,  generally peak in\nthe months of June and July,  and  decline  during the  months of  December  and\nJanuary. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs.\n\n                                       52\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations (Continued)\n\n     Hertz  maintains  domestic and foreign  commercial  paper programs to cover\nshort-term  funding needs,  and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business\npractice,  to fund international  needs. Hertz also is active in the medium-term\nand long-term debt markets.\n\n     During  2001,  Hertz  aligned its funding  strategy  with Ford  Credit's by\nreducing its reliance on commercial  paper and  increasing  its use of long-term\nfunding  sources to improve  its  liquidity,  and is planning  on  launching  an\nasset-backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002.\n\n     At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit  facilities  totaling $3.4\nbillion.  Of this amount,  $2.6 billion  represents  global and other  committed\ncredit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and\n$1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million\nconsists of  seasonal  short-term  facilities;  and $500  million  consists of a\nrevolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003.\n\nTotal Company\n-------------\n\n     Stockholders'  Equity  - Our  stockholders'  equity  was  $7.8  billion  at\n     ---------------------\nDecember 31, 2001,  down $10.8 billion  compared  with  December 31, 2000.  This\ndecrease  reflected  primarily net losses of $5.5 billion,  dividend payments of\n$1.9  billion,   foreign  currency  translation   adjustments  of  $1.2  billion\n(primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on\nderivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion\n(primarily  foreign  currency  hedges and interest  rate swaps) and $1.2 billion\nspent on share repurchases.\n\n     Dividends and Share  Repurchases - In October 2001,  our board of directors\n     --------------------------------\ndeclared a fourth  quarter 2001  dividend on Ford's  common and Class B stock of\n$0.15 per share,  which  represented  a 50%  reduction  from the $0.30 per share\ndividend  that had been paid since the fourth  quarter of 2000.  On January  11,\n2002, our board of directors  further  reduced the quarterly  dividend on common\nand Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share,\nwhich  represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend.  These\ndividend  reductions  will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5  billion  annually.\nAlso,  during 2001 we  purchased  $1.2  billion of our common stock under our $5\nbillion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000.  However,\nin May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely.\n\n     Debt  Ratings - Our  short-  and  long-term  debt are rated by three  major\n     -------------\nrating  agencies:  Fitch,  Inc.  (\"Fitch\");   Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc.\n(\"Moody's\");  and Standard & Poor's Rating  Services,  a division of McGraw-Hill\nCompanies, Inc. (\"S&P\"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are\nrated in several  local  markets by locally  recognized  rating  agencies.  Debt\nratings  reflect  an  assessment  by the  rating  agencies  of the  credit  risk\nassociated  with  particular  securities we issue,  and are based on information\nprovided by us or other sources that rating agencies  consider  reliable.  Lower\nratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital\nmarkets.  Long- and  short-term  debt ratings of BBB- and F3 or higher by Fitch,\nBaa3  and  P-3 or  higher  by  Moody's  and  BBB-  and A3 or  higher  by S&P are\nconsidered  \"investment grade.\" However, debt ratings are not recommendations to\nbuy,  sell, or hold  securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any\ntime by the  assigning  rating  agency.  Each rating  agency may have  different\ncriteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company,  and therefore  ratings\nshould be evaluated independently for each rating agency.\n\n     Fitch  Ratings.  On September 26, 2001,  Fitch  lowered the long-term  debt\nratings of Ford,  Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A- and lowered Ford  Credit's\nand Hertz' short-term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all\nentities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long-term debt ratings of Ford,\nFord  Credit and Hertz from A- to BBB+,  confirmed  Ford  Credit's  and  Hertz's\nshort-term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies\nas negative.\n\n     Moody's Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moody's lowered Ford's long-term debt\nrating from A2 to A3,  affirmed Ford Credit's long- and short-term  debt ratings\nat A2 and  Prime-1,  respectively,  and  changed  the  rating  outlook  for both\ncompanies  from  stable to  negative.  Moody's  also  lowered  Hertz'  long- and\nshort-term   debt  ratings  from  A3  to  Baa1  and  from  Prime-1  to  Prime-2,\nrespectively,  and changed its rating\n\n                                       53\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.

On January 16, 2002,  Moody's lowered Ford's long\nterm debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credit's long- and short-term debt\nratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime-1 to Prime-2,  respectively,  and confirmed\nthe rating  outlook of both  companies as negative.  Moody's also lowered Hertz'\nlong-term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short-term debt rating at\nPrime-2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative.\n\n     S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long-term debt ratings of\nFord and Ford Credit  from A to BBB+,  lowered  Ford  Credit's  short-term  debt\nrating from A-1 to A-2, and changed the rating  outlook for both  companies from\nnegative to stable.  S&P also lowered  Hertz's long- and short-term debt ratings\nfrom A- to BBB and from A-1 to A-2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook\nto stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies\nto negative.\n\n     Contractual  Obligations and  Commitments - For information  regarding debt\n     -----------------------------------------\nand  other  obligations  of  the  Automotive  and  Financial  Services  sectors,\nincluding  amounts  maturing in each of the next five years,  see Note 11 of the\nNotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition, we, as part of our\nnormal business practices,  enter into long-term arrangements with suppliers for\npurchases of certain raw materials,  components and services. These arrangements\nmay contain  fixed/minimum  quantity purchase  requirements.  We enter into such\narrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services.\n\n\nHERTZ PURCHASE\n\n     In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired\n(for a total price of about $735  million) the common stock of Hertz that we did\nnot own, which  represented  about 18% of the economic  interest in Hertz.  As a\nresult, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\n\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\n     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued SFAS\nNo.  141,  \"Business  Combinations\",  effective  for all  business  combinations\ninitiated  after June 30, 2001. The Statement  requires that the purchase method\nof accounting be used for all business  combinations  and specifies that certain\nacquired  intangible  assets in a business  combination  be recognized as assets\nseparately  from  goodwill  and  existing  intangible  assets  and  goodwill  be\nevaluated for these new separation  requirements.  We do not expect  adoption of\nthis Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated  financial position\nor results of operations.\n\n     We adopted SFAS No. 142,  \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" on January\n1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but\nwill be subject to an annual  impairment test. At year-end 2001, we had goodwill\nof $6.6 billion and other  intangible  assets of $1.3 billion.  We are presently\nevaluating the amount of the transitional  impairment,  which may range up to $2\nbillion  or more,  related  to  Kwik-Fit  and other  investments.  Goodwill  and\nindefinite-lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes\nwas charged to income in 2001.\n\n     In June  2001,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  143,  \"Accounting  for  Asset\nRetirement  Obligations\",  which requires entities to establish  liabilities for\nlegal obligations  associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets.\nWe will adopt the  Statement on January 1, 2003.  Although we are  assessing the\nimpact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on\nour consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n\n     In  August  2001,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  144,  \"Accounting  for the\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\". This Statement superseded SFAS No.\n121,  \"Accounting  for the  Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived\nAssets to Be Disposed Of\" and addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for\nimpairment of long-lived  assets to be held and used, and long-lived  assets and\ncomponents of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this  Statement on January\n1, 2002.  Although we are\n\n                                       54\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations (Continued)\n\nassessing the impact,  we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact\non our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n     Our  consolidated  financial  statements  are prepared in  conformity  with\nUnited States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these\nfinancial statements requires the use of estimates,  judgments,  and assumptions\nthat affect the reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  at the date of the\nfinancial  statements and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses  during\nthe periods presented.  The significant  accounting  principles which we believe\nare the most important to aid in fully  understanding  our financial results are\nthe following:\n\n     Product  warranties - estimated  warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us\nare accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer.  Estimates for warranty\ncosts are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included\nin our  warranty  cost  accruals are costs for basic  warranties  on vehicles we\nsell,  extended service plans (i.e.,  where customers pay a fee to have extended\nwarranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer\nsatisfaction  actions  outside  the base  warranty.  An  example  of a  customer\nsatisfaction  action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May\n2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our\nvehicles.  Warranty  cost  accruals are  adjusted  from time to time when actual\nwarranty claim experience differs from that estimated.\n\n     Marketing  incentives - costs for customer and dealer cash  incentives  and\ncosts for special  financing and leasing  programs that we sponsor  through Ford\nCredit (e.g., 0.0% financing  program) are recognized as sales reductions at the\nlater of the date the  related  vehicle  sales are  recorded  or at the date the\nincentive program is both approved and communicated.  In general,  the amount of\nfinancing  cost that we provide to Ford  Credit is the  difference  between  the\namounts offered to retail  customers and a market-based  interest or lease rate.\nCosts for marketing  incentives are based upon assumptions  regarding the number\nof vehicles  that will have a specific  incentive  applied  against them. To the\nextent  the  actual  number of  vehicles  differs  from this  estimate,  or if a\ndifferent mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted.\n\n     Retirement benefits - our employee pension and other postretirement benefit\n(i.e.,  health care and life  insurance)  costs and obligations are dependent on\nour assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions\ninclude discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth,\nlong-term  return on plan assets,  retirement  rates,  mortality rates and other\nfactors.  We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at\nyear-end on AA-rated corporate long-term bond yields. Our health care cost trend\nassumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term  outlook,\nand an assessment of likely long-term trends. Our inflation  assumption is based\non an evaluation of external market  indicators.  The salary growth  assumptions\nreflect our  long-term  actual  experience,  the  near-term  outlook and assumed\ninflation.  Retirement  and mortality  rates are based  primarily on actual plan\nexperience.  Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and\namortized over future periods and,  therefore,  generally  affect our recognized\nexpense and recorded  obligation in such future  periods.  While we believe that\nthe  assumptions  used  are  appropriate,   significant  differences  in  actual\nexperience or significant  changes in  assumptions  would affect our pension and\nother postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to\nour Consolidated  Financial Statements for more information  regarding costs and\nassumptions for employee retirement benefits.\n\n     Impairment of long-lived assets - we periodically review the carrying value\nof our long-lived  assets held and used and assets to be disposed of,  including\ngoodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such\na review.  We evaluate the carrying  value of  long-lived  assets for  potential\nimpairment  on a  regional  operating  business  unit basis  using  undiscounted\nafter-tax  estimated cash flows or on an individual  asset basis if the asset is\nheld for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of\n\n                                       55\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations (Continued)\n\nour North and South  American  Automotive  operations  in 2001 and our  European\nAutomotive operations in 2000.\n\n     Allowance for credit losses - the allowance for credit losses  reflects our\nestimate of losses  inherent in Ford Credit's  portfolio of finance  receivables\nand operating  leases.  These losses result from obligors or lessees  failing to\ntimely make principal,  interest or lease  payments.  Our estimates are based on\nseveral factors,  including prices of used vehicles,  loan-to-value  ratios, the\nnumber of payments  remaining to be made on the obligation  (all of which affect\nseverity of loss) and  economic  conditions  and the credit risk  quality of the\nportfolio  (both of which affect the frequency of defaults).  We monitor  credit\nloss performance  monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit\nlosses quarterly.  When we determine an account to be  uncollectible,  we reduce\nour finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our\nallowance  for credit  losses.  We increase our  allowance  for credit losses by\namounts we recover on finance  receivables  and lease  investments we previously\ncharged off as an  uncollectible  account.  For  information  regarding how Ford\nCredit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A.  \"Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures  About  Market  Risk - Ford  Credit  Market and Other Risks - Credit\nRisk.\"\n\n     Depreciation  expense on operating  leases and residual  values - we have a\nsignificant number of vehicles in Ford Credit's  operating lease portfolio.  Our\noperating  lease  customers pay us fixed monthly rental  payments that we cannot\nsubsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the\nopportunity of either  purchasing the vehicle for the lease-end  value specified\nin their  lease  contract  or  returning  the  vehicle to us. We sell at auction\nsubstantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease-end value based\non  a  proprietary   econometric  model  that  uses  historical  experience  and\nforward-looking  information,  such as our new product plans, marketing programs\nand quality  metrics.  We record  depreciation  expense for vehicles  subject to\noperating leases on a straight-line  basis over the term of the lease in amounts\nnecessary to reduce the vehicle to its  estimated  residual  value at the end of\nthe lease term.  Accumulated  depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and\nis included in our net investment in operating leases.\n\n     Initially,  depreciation  expense is based on our  assessment  of lease-end\nresidual value at the time of contract origination.  Monthly, we monitor vehicle\nline  performance  and,  quarterly,  we review the  adequacy of our  accumulated\ndepreciation  reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether\nadjustments are required are: lease  termination  volumes,  vehicle return rates\nand expected used-car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that\nmodifications  are  necessary,   we  will  record   adjustments  to  accumulated\ndepreciation  through earnings over the remaining life of the affected  vehicles\nin our portfolio.\n\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nIndustry Sales Volumes and Financial Results\n--------------------------------------------\n\nOur outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in\nour major markets is as follows:\n\n     United States  --   approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the\n                         17.5 million units sold in 2001\n     Europe         --   approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the\n                         17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on\n                         nineteen markets)\n     Brazil         --   approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6\n                         million units sold in 2001\n     Australia      --   approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000\n                         units sold in 2001\n\n     Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing\ncosts,  which  are  expected  to be higher in  2002),  we expect  2002  earnings\n(excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven,\n\n                                       56\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7.

In  addition,  we expect  the\noperating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on\nthe basis described under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Automotive Sector -\nGross Cash) to be negative in 2002.  Similar to the improvements in cost and the\nother  expected  benefits  of the  Revitalization  Plan,  we expect  to  achieve\nmeaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid-decade.\n\n\n2002 Financial Milestones\n-------------------------\n\n     We have set and communicated  certain financial  milestones for 2002.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n     We are  exposed  to a variety  of market  and other  risks,  including  the\neffects of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  commodity  prices,\ninterest  rates, as well as risks to  availability  of funding  sources,  hazard\nevents,  and  specific  asset  risks.  These  risks  affect our  Automotive  and\nFinancial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as\nan integral part of our overall risk management program,  which includes regular\nreports to a central  management  committee that oversees global risk management\npractices.  Our risk  management  program  recognizes  the  unpredictability  of\nmarkets and seeks to reduce profit  volatility.  For more  information  on these\nfinancial  exposures,  see  Notes  1 and 14 of  the  Notes  to our  Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\n     Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity\nrisk, or the  possibility of having to curtail their  businesses or being unable\nto meet  present  and  future  financial  obligations  as they come due  because\nfunding sources may be reduced or become unavailable.  We, and particularly Ford\nCredit,  which comprises  substantially  all of our Financial  Services  sector,\nmaintain plans for sources of funding to ensure  liquidity  through any economic\nor business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources\ninclude commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through  securitization\ntransactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources.\n\n     We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage\nto property,  liability  claims,  and employee injury.  We protect against these\nrisks  through a  combination  of self  insurance and the purchase of commercial\ninsurance  designed to protect  against events that could  generate  significant\nlosses.\n\n     The market and counterparty  risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit\nare discussed and quantified below.\n\n\nAUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK\n\n     Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts  denominated\nin foreign currencies,  including the following: purchases and sales of finished\nvehicles and production  parts, debt and other payables,  subsidiary  dividends,\nand investments in affiliates.  These expenditures and receipts create exposures\nto  changes  in  exchange  rates.  We also are  exposed  to changes in prices of\ncommodities used in our Automotive sector.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n---------------------\n\n     Foreign currency risk is the possibility  that our financial  results could\nbe better or worse than  planned  because of changes in exchange  rates.  We use\nderivative  instruments  to  hedge  assets,  liabilities  and  firm  commitments\ndenominated  in foreign  currencies.  Our  hedging  policy is designed to reduce\nincome  volatility  and is  based on  clearly  defined  guidelines.  Speculative\nactions are not permitted.  In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments\ncommonly used by  corporations  to reduce  foreign  exchange,  interest rate and\nother price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We\nuse a  value-at-risk  (\"VAR\")  analysis to evaluate  our  exposure to changes in\nforeign  currency  exchange  rates.  The  primary  assumptions  used  in the VAR\nanalysis are as follows:\n\n     o    A Monte Carlo  simulation  model is used to  calculate  changes in the\n          value of currency derivative  instruments (e.g., forwards and options)\n          and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an\n          18-month  exposure  and  derivative  hedging  horizon  and a one-month\n          holding period.\n\n                                       58\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)\n\n     o    The  VAR  analysis   calculates  the  potential  risk,  within  a  99%\n          confidence  level,  on  cross-border  currency  cash  flow  exposures,\n          including the effects of foreign  currency  derivatives.  (Translation\n          exposures  are not  included  in the VAR  analysis).  The Monte  Carlo\n          simulation model uses historical  volatility and correlation estimates\n          of the  underlying  assets to produce a large  number of future  price\n          scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution.\n\n     o    Estimates of correlations  and  volatilities  are drawn primarily from\n          the RiskMetricsTM datasets.\n\n     Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates.\nBased on our overall currency exposure (including  derivative  positions) during\n2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre-tax cash flow from currency  movements was\non average $300 million,  with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million.\nAt December 31, 2001,  currency  movements  are  projected to affect our pre-tax\ncash  flow over the next 18  months  by less  than  $275  million,  within a 99%\nconfidence  level.  Compared with our  projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001\nVAR amount is approximately  $25 million lower,  primarily  because of decreased\ncurrency exchange rate volatility.\n\nCommodity Price Risk\n--------------------\n\n     Commodity  price risk is the  possibility  of higher or lower  costs due to\nchanges in the prices of commodities,  such as non-ferrous (e.g.,  aluminum) and\nprecious metals (e.g., palladium,  platinum and rhodium),  ferrous alloys (e.g.,\nsteel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene),  which we\nuse in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative  instruments to hedge\nthe price risk  associated  with the purchase of those  commodities  that we can\neconomically  hedge.  The fair value liability of such contracts,  excluding the\nunderlying  exposures,  as of  December  31, 2001 and 2000 was  approximately  a\nnegative  $259 million and a positive $56 million,  respectively.  The potential\nchange in the fair value of commodity forward and option  contracts,  assuming a\n10%  change in the  underlying  commodity  price,  would be  approximately  $267\nmillion and $280  million at  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  This\namount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in\npurchasing the underlying commodities.\n\n     In addition to these price-hedging  activities,  our procurement activities\nensure that we have  adequate  supplies of raw  materials  used in our business.\nThese  procurement  activities  utilize forward  purchase  contracts,  long-term\nsupply contracts and stockpiles.  The $1 billion pre-tax  write-down of precious\nmetals,  discussed  in  Note  16 of  the  Notes  to our  Consolidated  Financial\nStatements,  related to these procurement  activities.  In conjunction with this\nwrite-down,  we modified our processes so that any price-hedging inherent in our\nprocurement  activities  is  executed  by or  coordinated  with our  Treasurer's\nOffice, which manages our price-hedging activity.\n\n     Our   price-hedging   policy  is  based  on  clearly  defined   guidelines.\nSpeculative actions are not permitted.  In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation\nto include a VAR  analysis,  using  historical  volatilities,  to  evaluate  our\nexposure to changes in commodity  prices  given our  financial  hedges,  forward\nprocurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge.\n\n     Based on our commodity  exposure and related hedging activity,  at December\n31, 2001,  commodity  price  movements  are projected to affect our pre-tax cash\nflow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million,  within a 99% confidence\nlevel.  Over the last year the VAR  measurements  averaged $339 million,  with a\nhigh  of  $625  million  and a low  of  $167  million.  These  risk  levels  are\nsubstantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions.\n\n\nCounterparty Risk\n-----------------\n\n     Counterparty  risk  relates  to the loss we could  incur if a  counterparty\ndefaulted on an  investment  or a  derivative  contract.  Exposures  managed are\nfinancial and  primarily  relate to  investments  in  fixed-income  products and\nderivative  transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and\ncommodity  risk. We,  together with Ford Credit,  establish  exposure limits for\neach counterparty to\n\n                                       59\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)\n\nminimize risk and provide counterparty diversification.  Exposures are monitored\non a regular basis.\n\n     Our  approach  to  managing   counterparty  risk  is  forward-looking   and\nproactive,  allowing us to take risk  mitigation  actions.  Exposure  limits are\nestablished for both mark-to-market and future potential exposure,  based on our\noverall risk tolerance and ratings-based  historical  default  probabilities.  A\nMonte Carlo simulation  technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure\nby tenor,  within a 95%  confidence  level  (market  convention).  Estimates  of\ncorrelations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets.\n\n\n\nFORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS\n\nOverview\n--------\n\n     Ford  Credit is  exposed  to risks in the  normal  course  of its  business\nactivities.  In addition to counterparty  risk discussed  above,  Ford Credit is\nsubject to the  following  additional  types of risks that it seeks to identify,\nassess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures:\n\n     o    Credit risk - the  possibility  of loss from a  customer's  failure to\n          make  payments  according  to contract  terms.\n     o    Residual risk - the possibility  that the actual proceeds  received by\n          Ford  Credit  upon  the  sale of  returned  lease  vehicles  at  lease\n          termination  will be lower  than its  internal  forecast  of  residual\n          values.\n     o    Market risk - the  possibility  that changes in future market interest\n          and  currency  exchange  rates  or  prices  will  make  Ford  Credit's\n          positions less valuable.\n     o    Liquidity  risk - the  possibility of being unable to meet all current\n          and future  obligations  in a timely  manner.\n     o    Operating  risk - the  possibility  of errors  relating to transaction\n          processing  and  systems,  actions  that  could  result in  compliance\n          deficiencies  with regulatory  standards or fraud by Ford Credit's own\n          employees or outside persons.\n\n     Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to\nFord  Credit's  overall  global  risk.  Business  decisions  are  evaluated on a\nrisk-adjusted  basis and products are priced  consistent  with these risks.  See\nFord  Motor  Credit  Company's  Annual  Report on  Form-10 K for the year  ended\nDecember 31, 2001 for more information on this subject.\n\nCredit Risk\n-----------\n\n     Ford  Credit  extends   consumer   credit  by  purchasing   retail  vehicle\ninstallment sale and lease contracts from vehicle  dealers.  These contracts are\ndivided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed\nor  leased is new or used.  Segment  data are used to ensure  that  pricing  and\nservicing  procedures  are  commensurate  with the  risk  associated  with  each\ncontract.  Ford Credit has behavioral  models to assist in determining  the best\ncollection  strategies.  In general,  collection procedures are designed to keep\naccounts current and to collect on delinquent  accounts.  As a final step, after\nreasonable  collection efforts have failed,  vehicles are repossessed;  however,\ncollection  efforts of any remaining  balance continue until the account is paid\nin full or determined to be uncollectible.\n\n     Ford Credit also extends  non-consumer  loans,  which include wholesale and\nother loans to dealers as well as automotive  financing for commercial entities.\nTo monitor credit  performance,  Ford Credit requires  dealers to submit monthly\nfinancial  statements,  performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more\nfrequent audits for higher risk dealers),  and monitors  inventory payoffs daily\nto detect  adverse  deviations  from  typical  payoff  patterns,  in which  case\nappropriate actions are taken.\n\n                                       60\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)\n\nResidual Risk\n-------------\n\n     Ford Credit's  lease  contracts are written with vehicle  lease-end  values\nthat  approximate  residual values  published in Automotive  Leasing Guide.  For\nfinancial  reporting purposes,  however,  Ford Credit sets the internal value of\nexpected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model\nthat uses  historical  experience and forward  looking  information  such as new\nproduct  plans,   marketing  programs  and  quality  metrics.   Any  unfavorable\ndifference  between the  customer  contract  lease-end  value and Ford  Credit's\ninternal  forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation.  Ford Credit reviews\nthe depreciation  rates on leased vehicles  quarterly and adjusts them as needed\nto reflect changes in the projected residual values.\n\n     At lease  termination,  Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the\nuse of models to  determine  which  geographic  market  would  yield the highest\nresale value, net of transportation cost.  Sometimes,  lease extensions or early\nterminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns.\n\nMarket Risk\n-----------\n\n     The goal of  financial  market  risk  management  is to reduce  the  profit\nvolatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford\nCredit  uses  various  financial  instruments,  particularly  interest  rate and\ncurrency swaps to manage market risk.  Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of\nthese instruments,  which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not\nengage in any trading,  market-making  or other  speculative  activities  in the\nderivative markets.\n\n     Since Ford Credit's principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches\nbetween  the terms of assets  and  liabilities,  changes in  interest  rates and\nexchange  rates  would have  generally  offsetting  effects on the value of Ford\nCredit's financial assets and derivative  instruments and, therefore,  would not\nbe expected to have a material  impact on Ford  Credit's  financial  position or\nresults of operations.  For instance,  assuming an instantaneous increase of one\npercentage  point in interest  rates applied to all financial  assets,  debt and\nhedging  instruments,  Ford  Credit's  after-tax  earnings  would decline by $66\nmillion over the ensuing twelve-month period.\n\n\nLiquidity Risk\n--------------\n\n     One of Ford Credit's major objectives is to maintain  funding  availability\nthrough any  economic  or business  cycle.  Ford  Credit  focuses on  developing\nfunding  sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit\nalso issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate,  further\nenhancing overall liquidity.\n\n     Global funding activities  include the direct and dealer-placed  commercial\npaper,  the  placement of term debt to retail and  institutional  investors  and\npublic and private sale of receivables.  Ford Credit's ability to raise funds at\na competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings.\n\n     Management  closely  monitors the amount of  short-term  funding and mix of\nshort-term funding to total debt, the overall  composition of total debt and the\navailability  of  committed  credit  facilities  in  relation  to the  level  of\noutstanding  short-term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credit's liquidity position\nis conducted periodically.\n\n     For a  detailed  discussion  of Ford  Credit's  funding  sources  and  debt\nratings,  see  Item  7.  \"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\n\n                                       61\n\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)\n\nOperating Risk\n--------------\n\n     Ford Credit  operates in many  locations and relies on the abilities of its\nemployees  and  systems  to  process a large  number of  transactions.  Improper\noperation  of systems or improper  employee  actions  could  result in financial\nloss,  regulatory action and damage to our reputation.  To address this risk, we\nand Ford Credit maintain  internal control  processes that identify  transaction\nauthorization  requirements,  safeguard  assets from misuse or theft, and ensure\nthe reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to\nmaintain the accuracy of information  about our  operations.  These controls are\ndesigned to manage operating risk throughout our operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem 8.

------------------------------------------\n\nNOTE 1.  Accounting Policies\n----------------------------\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n---------------------------\nOur consolidated financial statements include our majority-owned subsidiaries\nand reflect our two business sectors: Automotive and Financial Services.\nAffiliates that we do not control, but have a significant influence over\noperating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method.\nSubsidiaries where control is expected to be temporary, principally investments\nin certain dealerships, are also accounted for on an equity basis. We prepare\nour financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States which require management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates and assumptions. Certain amounts previously disclosed in our press\nrelease and current report on Form 8-K dated January 17, 2002 have been\nreclassified, and certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to\nconform with current reporting.\n\nStructure of Operations\n-----------------------\nOur company's sectors, Automotive and Financial Services, are managed as three\nprimary operating segments (Note 18). The Automotive sector (and segment)\nconsists of the design, manufacture, sale, and service of cars and trucks. The\nFinancial Services sector primarily includes two segments, Ford Credit and\nHertz. Ford Credit is comprised of subsidiaries that provide vehicle-related\nfinancing, leasing, and insurance. Hertz rents and leases cars and trucks and\nrents industrial and construction equipment.

Ford Credit records these transactions as\nrevenue  over the life of the  contract.  Amounts  recorded  as  revenue  by the\nFinancial  Services  sector,  and  billed to the  Automotive  sector,  were $4.0\nbillion  in 2001,  $3.4  billion  in 2000,  and $3.2  billion  in 1999.  For the\nAutomotive  sector,  estimated  costs for these  sales  incentive  programs  are\nrecorded as sales  reductions as described  below under  \"Revenue  Recognition -\nAutomotive Sector\".\n\nRevenue Recognition - Automotive Sector\n---------------------------------------\nSales are generally recorded when products are shipped to customers and\nownership is transferred. Sales with a guaranteed repurchase option are\naccounted for as operating leases over the expected period prior to repurchase.\nThe carrying value of these vehicles, included in other current assets, was $2\nbillion at both December 31, 2001 and 2000. Estimated costs for sales incentive\nprograms are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related\nsales are recorded, or at the date the program is both approved and\ncommunicated.\n\n                                      FS-5\n<PAGE>\n\nNOTE 1.  Accounting Policies (Continued)\n----------------------------\n\nRevenue Recognition - Financial Services Sector\n-----------------------------------------------\nRevenue from finance receivables, net of certain deferred loan origination costs\nthat are included as a reduction of financing revenue, is recognized over the\nterm of the receivable using the interest method. Revenue from operating leases,\nnet of certain deferred origination costs, is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the term of the lease. The accrual of interest on loans is\ndiscontinued at the time the loan is impaired. Subsequent amounts of interest\ncollected are recognized in income only if full recovery of the remaining\nprincipal is probable. Interest supplements paid by the Automotive sector are\nrecognized over the term of the receivable or operating lease. The Automotive\nsector records interest supplements as sales incentives.\n\nWarranty\n-------\nEstimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the\nvehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based\nprimarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost\naccruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service\nplans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond\nthe base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions\noutside the base warranty.\n\nSelected Other Costs\n--------------------\nFreight costs are accrued at the time of sale and are included in cost of sales.\nAdvertising and engineering, research and development costs are expensed as\nincurred and were as follows (in billions):\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                                  2001           2000            1999\n                                                               -----------    -----------     -----------\n<s>                                                             <c>            <c>             <c>\n    Advertising                                                 $3.1           $3.0            $2.7\n    Engineering, research and development                        7.4            6.8             6.0\n</TABLE>\n\nSpecial Purpose Entities\n------------------------\nFord Credit sells finance receivables to special purpose entities (or SPEs) in\nsecuritization transactions. These SPEs typically issue securities in the form\nof notes and certificates that are structured into several classes with senior\nclasses having priority of payment over subordinated classes. In these\ntransactions, Ford Credit retains certain securities and other interests in the\nsold receivables referred to as retained interests. The retained interests may\ninclude senior notes, subordinated certificates, restricted cash held for the\nbenefit of SPEs and interest-only strips. Subordinated certificates represent\nlower rated classes of securities issued by SPEs. Restricted cash consists of a\nportion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay\ninterest and principal to investors if collections on the sold receivables are\ninsufficient, with any remaining restricted cash returned to Ford Credit after\ninvestors are fully paid. Interest-only strips, also referred to as excess\nspread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold receivables in\nexcess of amounts needed to pay interest and principal to investors and\nservicing fees. The retained interests (other than senior notes) serve as credit\nenhancement to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs.\n\nIn the period the sale occurs, estimated gains or losses from the sale of\nfinance receivables are recognized based on the relative fair value of the\nportion sold and the portion allocated to retained interests. The retained\ninterests are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded, net of\ntax, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\nIn Ford Credit's wholesale receivables securitization program, the SPE owns a\npool of wholesale receivables from selected dealer accounts. Ford Credit is\nrequired to sell wholesale receivables generated under the selected dealer\naccounts from time to time to the SPE. Ford Credit retains the portion of the\nsold wholesale receivables that is in excess of the minimum receivables level\nrequired to support the securities issued by the SPE. A part of this retained\ninterest is available as credit enhancement to senior noteholders. This retained\ninterest fluctuates as receivables levels increase or decrease over time and as\nadditional series of securities are issued by the SPE or are paid off. This\nretained interest is recorded at fair value.\n\nThe number of off-balance sheet SPEs and the amount of assets (in billions) held\nby such SPEs were as follows:\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                                          December 31,\n                                                          Number              2001\n                                                     ------------------ ------------------\n<s>                                                        <c>              <c>\n     Ford Credit\n       Retail finance receivables                          47               $41.3\n       Wholesale finance receivables                        3                17.4\n                                                           --               -----\n        Total Ford Credit                                  50                58.7\n     Ford Automotive receivables                            1                 0.1\n     Hertz                                                  -                   -\n                                                           --               -----\n         Total                                             51               $58.8\n                                                           ==               =====\n</TABLE>\n                                      FS-6\n<PAGE>\n\nNOTE 1.

Intangible assets acquired prior to June 30, 2001 were amortized\nthrough year-end 2001 using the straight-line method over periods not exceeding\n40 years. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 eliminates\nthe requirement to amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets, which will\nbe subject to an annual impairment test. The total goodwill included in the\nAutomotive sector's other assets was $5.3 billion and $5.8 billion at December\n31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total goodwill included in the Financial\nServices sector's other assets was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31,\n2001 and 2000, respectively. Other intangibles included in the Automotive\nsector's other assets were $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2001\nand 2000, respectively. We are presently evaluating the amount of the\ntransitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to\nKwik-Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset\namortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n-------------------------------\nWe evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment on\na regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after-tax estimated\ncash flows or at the individual asset level if held for sale.\n\nCompany-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTrust\n----\nFord Motor Company Capital Trust I (the \"Trust\") has outstanding $632 million 9%\nTrust Originated Preferred Securities (the \"Preferred Securities\"). The sole\nassets of the Trust are $651 million aggregate principal amount of Ford Motor\nCompany 9% Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 2025 (the \"Debentures\").\nAt our option, we may redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, on or after\nDecember 1, 2002. To the extent we redeem the Debentures and upon the maturity\nof the Debentures, the Trust is required to redeem the Preferred Securities at\n$25 per share plus accrued and unpaid distributions. We guarantee the payment of\nall distributions and other payments on the Preferred Securities to the extent\nnot paid by the Trust, but only if and to the extent we have made a payment of\ninterest or principal on the Debentures.\n\nEuropean Parliament End of Life Vehicle Directive\n-------------------------------------------------\nMember states of the European Union are presently proposing laws that are\nexpected to require us and other original equipment manufacturers to take back,\nrecycle, and dispose of certain vehicles.

Deferred taxes for these unremitted earnings\nare not practicable to estimate.\n\nNon-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes were $3.5 billion at\nDecember 31, 2001. A substantial portion of these losses has an indefinite\ncarryforward period; the remaining losses will begin to expire in 2003. Tax\nbenefits of operating loss carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis,\nincluding a review of historical and projected future operating results, the\neligible carryforward period, and other circumstances.\n\nNOTE 3.  Discontinued Operation\n-------------------------------\nOn June 28, 2000, we distributed our 100% ownership interest in Visteon\nCorporation, our former automotive components subsidiary, by means of a tax-free\nspin-off in the form of a dividend on Ford Common and Class B Stock. The total\nmarket value of the distribution was $2.1 billion, which resulted in an\nafter-tax loss of $2.3 billion. This loss represented the excess of the carrying\nvalue of our net investment over the market value on the distribution date. Our\nfinancial statements reflect Visteon as a \"discontinued operation\" for all\nperiods shown.\n\nIn connection with the spin-off of Visteon, about 24,000 hourly employees\nworking for Visteon who were represented by the UAW remained Ford employees,\nwith Visteon agreeing to reimburse Ford for the costs of those employees. The\naverage number of these employees in 2001 was approximately 20,500. Ford retains\n\n                                     FS-8\n<PAGE>\n\nNOTE 3.  Discontinued Operation (Continued)\n-------------------------------\n\ncertain pension and postretirement benefit obligations for qualified salaried\nemployees that are working or who have worked for Visteon.\n\nVisteon's revenues, not included in Ford's revenues for periods prior to\nspin-off, totaled $10.5 billion and $19.4 billion for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2000 and 1999. Income from discontinued operations for the years\nended December 31, 2000 and 1999 is reported net of income tax expense of\n$182 million and $422 million.\n\nNOTE 4.  Marketable and Other Securities\n----------------------------------------\nTrading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses\nincluded in income. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value\nwith net unrealized holding gains and losses reported, net of tax, in other\ncomprehensive income. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized\ncost. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific\nidentification method.\n\nThe fair value of substantially all securities is determined by quoted market\nprices. The estimated fair value of securities for which there are no quoted\nmarket prices is based on similar types of securities that are traded in the\nmarket. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are\nrecorded at cost. Book value approximates fair value for all securities.\n\nExpected maturities of debt securities may differ from contractual maturities\nbecause borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or\nwithout penalty.\n\nInvestments in securities at December 31 were as follows (in millions):\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                            2001                                        2000\n                                         -------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------\n\n                                          Amortized        Unrealized        Book/      Amortized       Unrealized       Book/\n                                                       ------------------    Fair                   -----------------    Fair\n                                             Cost       Gains    Losses      Value         Cost       Gains   Losses     Value\n                                         ------------- -------- --------- ----------- ------------- -------- -------- ----------\n<s>                                       <c>           <c>      <c>      <c>          <c>           <c>      <c>     <c>\n  Automotive Sector\n  -----------------\n  Trading                                 $ 9,374       $32      $30      $ 9,376      $10,214       $73      $ 4     $10,283\n  Available-for-sale\n    Corporate debt                          1,557        20        4        1,573        1,480         8        -       1,488\n  Held-to-maturity *                            -         -        -            -        1,345         -        -       1,345\n                                          -------       ---      ---      -------      -------       ---      ---     -------\n    Total                                 $10,931       $52      $34      $10,949      $13,039       $81      $ 4     $13,116\n                                          =======       ===      ===      =======      =======       ===      ===     =======\n\n  Financial Services Sector\n  -------------------------\n  Trading                                 $    95       $ -      $ -      $    95      $   258       $ 1      $ 1     $   258\n\n  Available-for-sale\n    U.S. government and agency                 78         2        1           79           94         4        -          98\n    Municipal                                   -         -        -            -           13         1        -          14\n    Government - non U.S.                      18         1        -           19           14         1        -          15\n    Corporate debt                            163         6        1          168          198         4        1         201\n    Mortgage-backed                           207         4        2          209          167         2        2         167\n    Equity                                     29        27        4           52           27        34        3          58\n                                          -------       ---      ---      -------      -------       ---      ---     -------\n      Total                                   495        40        8          527          513        46        6         553\n\n  Held-to-maturity\n    U.S. government                             6         -        -            6            6         -        -           6\n                                          -------       ---      ---      -------      -------       ---      ---     -------\n        Total                             $   596       $40      $ 8      $   628      $   777       $47      $ 7     $   817\n                                          =======       ===      ===      =======      =======       ===      ===     =======\n   - - - - -\n   *  Sold for $1,377 million in cash and realized a gain of $32 million in 2001.\n</TABLE>\n\nThe proceeds and gains/(losses) from available-for-sale securities were as\nfollows (in millions):\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                            Proceeds                            Gains/(Losses)\n                                  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------\n                                       2001           2000            2001           2000            1999\n                                  --------------- -------------- --------------- -------------- ---------------\n<s>                                <c>              <c>              <c>             <c>           <c>\n  Automotive                       $12,395          $4,938           $47             $2            $(7)\n  Financial Services                   745             557            11              3             19\n\n</TABLE>\n                                     FS-9\n<PAGE>\n\nNOTE 4.

Stock Options\n-----------------------\n\nWe have stock options outstanding under the 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\nand the 1998 LTIP. No further grants may be made under the 1990 LTIP and all\noutstanding options are exerciseable. Grants may be made under the 1998 LTIP\nthrough April 2008. All outstanding options under the 1990 LTIP continue to be\ngoverned by the terms and conditions of the existing option agreements for those\ngrants. Under the 1998 LTIP, 33% of the options are generally exercisable after\nthe first anniversary of the date of grant, 66% after the second anniversary,\nand 100% after the third anniversary. Stock options expire 10 years from the\ngrant date. Performance stock rights (PSRs) and restricted stock units (RSUs)\nare based on performance achievement. At December 31, 2001, 6.5 million PSRs and\n2.8 million RSUs were outstanding. Stock options, SARs, PSRs, and RSUs are\ndescribed in Ford's Proxy Statement.\n\nUnder the 1998 LTIP, 2% of our issued common stock as of December 31 becomes\navailable for granting plan awards in the succeeding calendar year. Any unused\nportion is available for later years. The limit may be increased up to 3% in any\nyear, with a corresponding reduction in shares available for grants in future\nyears. At December 31, 2001, the number of unused shares carried forward\naggregated to 42.3 million shares.\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                      2001                      2000                      1999\n                                            ------------------------ ------------------------- ---------------------------\n                                                          Weighted-                 Weighted-                 Weighted-\n                                                           Average                   Average                   Average\n                                               Shares      Exercise     Shares       Exercise     Shares       Exercise\nStock Option Activity                        (millions)     Price     (millions)      Price     (millions)      Price\n---------------------                       ------------ ----------- ------------ ------------ ------------ --------------\n<s>                                           <c>         <c>          <c>          <c>           <c>         <c>\nOutstanding, beginning of period              153.7       $19.16        75.3        $32.66        70.9        $25.67\nGranted                                        35.3        30.49        15.8         41.02        14.9         57.84\nAdjustment a/                                                           71.4\nExercised b/                                  (14.0)       12.07        (6.9)        15.15        (9.1)        20.26\nTerminated/expired or surrendered              (2.9)       25.91        (1.9)        32.94        (1.4)        27.98\n                                              -----                    -----                      ----\nOutstanding, end of period                    172.1        22.01       153.7         19.16        75.3         32.66\n                                              =====                    =====                      ====\nExercisable, end of period                    113.2        18.74       100.3         15.59        41.8         23.51\n   - - - - -\n   a/  Outstanding stock options and related exercise prices were adjusted to\n       preserve the intrinsic value of options as a result of the Visteon\n       spin-off and Value Enhancement Plan in 2000.\n   b/  Exercised at option prices ranging from $5.75 to $26.59 during 2001,\n       $5.75 to $23.87 during 2000, and $10.43 to $44.75 during 1999.\n</TABLE>\n                                     FS-14\n<PAGE>\n\nNOTE 13.

Derivative Financial Instruments\n------------------------------------------\nWe adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting\nfor Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, on January 1,\n2001. Our operations are exposed to global market risks, including the effect of\nchanges in currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. We use\nderivatives to manage these financial exposures as an integral part of our\noverall risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative\npurposes. We recognize fair value hedges through earnings and cash flow hedges\nthrough other comprehensive income. In prior years, gains and losses on currency\nand interest rate derivatives were deferred and recognized through earnings with\nthe related underlying transactions.\n\nExchange rate risk is managed by use of foreign currency agreements, including\nforward contracts, swaps, and options. Commodity price risk is managed by use of\nforward price contracts and options. Exchange rate and commodity risk\nderivatives are primarily accounted for as cash flow hedges and generally mature\nin 3 years or less, with a maximum maturity of 8 years. Interest rate risk is\nmanaged by entering into interest rate swap agreements to change the interest\nrate characteristics of our debt (primarily used in the Financial Services\nsector) to match the interest rate characteristics of related assets. These\ninterest rate derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value\nhedges. In addition, we use forward contracts to hedge certain net investments\nin foreign operations and hold other derivatives that presently do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133. During the fourth quarter of\n2001, we reevaluated our plans with respect to certain forward purchase\ncommitments for various precious metals commodities that were previously\nexcluded from the scope of SFAS No. 133 and determined that they no longer\nqualify for exclusion. Accordingly, we recorded a mark-to-market adjustment of\n$449 million in our Automotive sector as of December 31, 2001 (Note 16).\nDerivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges comprise most of the balance of\nSFAS No. 133 activity reported as a part of stockholders' equity.\n\n                                     FS-15\n<PAGE>\n\n NOTE 14.

We expect to reclassify\nlosses of $663 million ($96 million relates to transition adjustment) from\nstockholders' equity to net income during the next twelve months.

As part\nof these reviews, we determined that projected undiscounted cash flows were not\nsufficient to justify the carrying values of the related long-lived assets.\nAsset impairment charges of $3,084 million in North America and $744 million in\nSouth America were recorded in Automotive cost of sales, reflecting a write-down\nto estimated fair value, as determined by independent valuations. The impairment\nincreased depreciation, special tool amortization, and goodwill amortization by\n$2,688 million, $867 million, and $273 million, respectively.\n\nPrecious metals (primarily palladium) are used in catalytic converters, required\nto meet automotive emission standards. Our business objective has been to ensure\nadequate supply of these critical commodities. In 2000 and early 2001, we\nacquired precious metals and entered into forward purchase contracts at\nthen-prevailing market prices in an environment of uncertain supply and outlook\n(characterized by periodic supply interruptions by a major producer, Russia, and\nsubstantial increases in commodity prices - e.g., palladium prices rose from\nabout $200 an ounce in 1997 to about $1,100 an ounce in January 2001). In the\nfourth quarter of 2001, our engineers validated a breakthrough catalyst design,\nwhich will help reduce our usage of palladium (2002 usage is projected to be\ndown more than 50% from our usage in 2000). For our precious metals physically\nheld, we have accordingly revised our stocking requirements and are in the\nprocess of reducing metals that are in excess of those stocking requirements\n(including market sales to the extent the market can absorb the metal in an\norderly fashion). We have written down the value of the excess metal to its\nestimated realizable value (equal to year-end market price). For precious metal\nforward purchase contracts (all of which were previously planned for normal use\nin production), we now are planning a number of actions, including cash settling\ncontracts in lieu of taking physical delivery of the related metal. Therefore,\nas required by SFAS No. 133, precious metal forward purchase contracts have been\nmarked-to-market as of December 31, 2001. The total pre-tax charge for precious\nmetals was $953 million.\n\nPersonnel charges of $565 million before taxes primarily reflected voluntary\nsalaried employee separations in North America.\n\nOther pre-tax charges mainly reflected a $201 million non-cash charge to equity\nin net income of affiliated companies, representing our share of a charge\nrelated to Mazda's pension expenses, and a $160 million charge related to a\nmajor devaluation of the Argentine peso.\n\nPurchase of Remainder of Hertz Corporation - In March, we acquired (for $735\n------------------------------------------\nmillion) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about\n18% of the economic interest in Hertz. The excess of the purchase price over the\nfair market value of net assets acquired was approximately $390 million and was\namortized over 40 years in 2001.\n                                     FS-17\n<PAGE>\n\nNOTE 16.  Automotive Sector Acquisitions, Dispositions, Restructurings and Other\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nActions (Continued)\n-------\n\n2000\n----\nPurchase of Land Rover Business - In June, we purchased the Land Rover sport\n-------------------------------\nutility vehicle business from the BMW Group for 3 billion euros (equivalent to\n$2.6 billion). We paid two-thirds of the purchase price at closing and will pay\nthe remainder in 2005. The excess of the purchase price over the fair market\nvalue of net assets acquired was approximately $775 million and was amortized\nover 40 years in 2000 and 2001.\n\nEuropean Charges - Following an extensive review of the Ford brand Automotive\n----------------\noperations in Europe, we recorded a pre-tax charge in Automotive cost of sales\nof $1.6 billion in the second quarter. This charge included $1.1 billion for\nasset impairments and $468 million for restructuring costs. Employee separation\nincluded a workforce reduction of about 3,300 employees (2,900 hourly and 400\nsalaried) related to the planned cessation of vehicle production at the Dagenham\n(U.K.) Body and Assembly Plant. As of December 31, 2001, we have utilized $197\nmillion of the $468 million restructuring charge relating to a workforce\nreduction of 2,365 employees and $20 million of other exit related costs.\n\nThe asset impairment charge, attributable to excess capacity related to Ford's\nperformance in the European market, reflected the write-down of certain\nlong-lived assets, as determined by an independent valuation.\n\nNemak Joint Venture - During the fourth quarter, we recorded in Automotive cost\n-------------------\nof sales a pre-tax charge of $205 million related to the fair value transfer of\nour Windsor Aluminum Plant, Essex Aluminum Plant, and Casting Process\nDevelopment Center for an increased equity interest in our joint venture with\nNemak. We reflected the new joint venture in our consolidated financial\nstatements on an equity basis.\n\n1999\n----\nPurchase of AB Volvo's Worldwide Passenger Car Business (\"Volvo Car\") -\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn March, we purchased Volvo Car for $6.45 billion. The acquisition price\nincluded a cash payment of $2 billion on March 31, 1999, a deferred payment\nobligation to AB Volvo of $1.6 billion paid April 2, 2001, and Volvo Car\nautomotive net indebtedness of $2.9 billion. Most automotive indebtedness was\nrepaid April 12, 1999. The excess of the purchase price over the fair market\nvalue of net assets acquired was approximately $2.5 billion and was amortized\nover 40 years during 1999, 2000, and 2001.\n\nPurchase of Kwik-Fit Holdings plc - During the third quarter, we completed the\n---------------------------------\npurchase of all the outstanding stock of Kwik-Fit plc (\"Kwik-Fit\"). Kwik-Fit was\nEurope's largest independent vehicle maintenance and light repair chain. The\npurchase price was $1.6 billion and consisted of cash payments of $1.4 billion\nand loan notes to certain Kwik-Fit shareholders of $200 million, redeemable\nbeginning April 30, 2000 and on any subsequent interest payment date. The excess\nof the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired was\napproximately $1.1 billion and was amortized over 30 years during 1999, 2000,\nand 2001.\n\nDissolution of AutoEuropa Joint Venture - On January 1, 1999, we dissolved our\n---------------------------------------\nminivan joint venture with Volkswagen AG in Portugal (AutoEuropa) resulting in a\n$255 million pre-tax gain credited to Automotive cost of sales.\n\n                                     FS-18\n<PAGE>\n\nNOTE 17.  Retirement Benefits\n-----------------------------\n\nEmployee Retirement Plans\n-------------------------\nWe have two principal defined benefit retirement plans in the U.S. The Ford-UAW\nRetirement Plan covers hourly employees represented by the UAW, and the General\nRetirement Plan covers substantially all other Ford employees in the U.S. The\nhourly plan provides noncontributory benefits related to employee service. The\nsalaried plan provides similar noncontributory benefits and contributory\nbenefits related to pay and service. Other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries have\nseparate plans that generally provide similar types of benefits for their\nemployees. Ford-UAW Retirement Plan expense accruals for employees assigned to\nVisteon are charged to Visteon.\n\nIn general, our plans are funded, with the main exceptions of the U.S. defined\nbenefit plans for executives and certain plans in Germany; in such cases, an\nunfunded liability is recorded.\n\nOur policy for funded plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts\nrequired by applicable laws, regulations, and union agreements. Plan assets\nconsist principally of investments in stocks and government and other fixed\nincome securities. At December 31, 2001, stocks represented 73% of the market\nvalue of pension assets for our principal U.S. plans and fixed income securities\nrepresented 27%. Ford securities comprised less than one-half of one percent of\nthe value of our worldwide pension plan assets during 2000 and 2001.\n\nWe also sponsor defined contribution plans for certain of our U.S. and non-U.S.\nemployees.  Our expense, primarily for matching contributions, for these plans\nwas (in millions): $153 in 2001, $145 in 2000, and $140 in 1999.  Effective\nJanuary 1, 2002, we suspended matching contributions to these plans.\n\nPostretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits\n------------------------------------------------------\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor plans to provide selected health care\nand life insurance benefits for retired employees. Our U.S. and Canadian\nemployees generally may become eligible for those benefits if they retire;\nhowever, benefits and eligibility rules may be modified from time to time.\nPostretirement health care and life insurance expense accruals for hourly\nemployees assigned to Visteon and for salaried Visteon employees who met certain\nage and service conditions at June 30, 2000 are charged to Visteon.

In making this\nassumption, we review the outlook for inflation, fixed income returns and equity\nreturns, taking into consideration our plans' historical returns, our asset\nallocation and investment strategy, as well as the views of investment managers\nand other large pension plan sponsors. Although not a guarantee of future\nresults, the average annual return of our U.S. pension fund has exceeded 9.5%\nfor the last 10, 20 and 30-year periods. As a sensitivity measure, a one-half\npoint decrease/increase in our U.S. assumed return would increase/decrease\nfuture annual U.S. pension pre-tax expense by about $190 million and would have\nno effect on pension funded status or contribution requirements.\n\nA one percentage point increase/(decrease) in the assumed health care cost trend\nrate would increase/(decrease) the postretirement health care benefit obligation\nby approximately $3.1 billion/($2.6 billion) and the service and interest\ncomponent of this expense by $310 million/($241) million.\n\n                                     FS-20\n\n<PAGE>\n\nNOTE 18.

Litigation and Claims\n-------------------------------\nVarious legal actions, governmental investigations and proceedings and claims\nare pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us, including\nthose arising out of alleged defects in our products; governmental regulations\nrelating to safety, emissions and fuel economy; financial services;\nemployment-related matters; dealer, supplier and other contractual\nrelationships; intellectual property rights; product warranties; environmental\nmatters; and shareholder matters. Certain of the pending legal actions are, or\npurport to be, class actions. Some of the foregoing matters involve or may\ninvolve compensatory, punitive, or antitrust or other treble damage claims in\nvery large amounts, or demands for recall campaigns, environmental remediation\nprograms, sanctions, or other relief which, if granted, would require very large\nexpenditures.\n\nLitigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual\nlitigated matters is not predictable with assurance. We have established\nreserves for certain of the matters discussed in the foregoing paragraph where\nlosses are deemed probable. It is reasonably possible, however, that some of the\nmatters discussed in the foregoing paragraph for which reserves have not been\nestablished could be decided unfavorably to us and could require us to pay\ndamages or make other expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts that cannot\nbe estimated at December 31, 2001. We do not reasonably expect, based on our\nanalysis, that such matters would have a material effect on future consolidated\nfinancial statements for a particular year, although such an outcome is\npossible.\n\nNOTE 21.

These financial statements are the responsibility\nof the  Company's  management;  our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on\nthese financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these\nstatements  in  accordance  with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the\nUnited  States of America,  which  require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of\nmaterial  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence\nsupporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and\nevaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements,  on January 1,\n2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,\n\"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\".\n\n\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nDetroit, Michigan\nFebruary 15, 2002\n\n\n                                     FS-23\n\n\n</TEXT>\n</DOCUMENT>\n"),
