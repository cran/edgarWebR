As of February 26, 2002, Ford had outstanding 1,735,756,535 shares of Common
Stock and 70,852,076 shares of Class B Stock. Based on the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Transaction closing price of the Common Stock on that date
($15.55 a share), the aggregate market value of such Common Stock was
$26,991,014,119. Although there is no quoted market for our Class B Stock,
shares of Class B Stock may be converted at any time into an equal number of
shares of Common Stock for the purpose of effecting the sale or other
disposition of such shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock and Class
B Stock outstanding at February 26, 2001 included shares owned by persons who
may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Ford. We do not believe, however, that any
such person should be considered to be an affiliate. For information concerning
ownership of outstanding Common Stock and Class B Stock, see the Proxy Statement
for Ford's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 9, 2002 (our "Proxy
Statement"), which is incorporated by reference under various Items of this

                                     PART I

Item 1.  Business
-----------------

         Ford Motor Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1919. We acquired
the business of a Michigan company, also known as Ford Motor Company,
incorporated in 1903 to produce and sell automobiles designed and engineered by
Henry Ford. We are the world's second-largest producer of cars and trucks
combined. We and our subsidiaries also engage in other businesses, including
financing and renting vehicles and equipment.


                                    Overview

         Our business is divided into two business sectors: the Automotive
sector and the Financial Services sector. We manage these sectors as three
primary operating segments as described below.
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>


Business Sectors       Operating Segments           Description
----------------       ------------------           -----------
<s>                    <c>                          <c>
Automotive:
                       Automotive                   design, manufacture, sale, and service
                                                    of cars and trucks

Financial Services:
                       Ford Motor Credit Company    vehicle-related financing, leasing, and
                                                    insurance

                       The Hertz Corporation        renting and leasing of cars and trucks and
                                                    renting industrial and construction
                                                    equipment, and other activities
</TABLE>

     We provide financial  information (such as, revenues,  income,  and assets)
for each of these business sectors and operating segments in three areas of this
Report:  (1) Item 6. "Selected  Financial Data" on pages 36 through 38; (2) Item
7. "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of
Operations"  on  pages  39  through  57;  and (3)  Note 18 of the  Notes  to our
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  located  at the  end of this  Report  (page
FS-21).  Financial  information  relating  to certain  geographic  areas is also
included in the above-mentioned areas of this Report.


Revitalization Plan
-------------------

     Following an extensive  review of our North and South American  operations,
on January 11, 2002,  we announced a  revitalization  plan (the  "Revitalization
Plan") that includes the following elements:

     o    New products: A product-led revitalization program that will result in
          the introduction of 20 new or freshened  products in the United States
          annually between now and mid-decade.

     o    Plant  capacity:  Reduction  of  North  American  plant  manufacturing
          operating  capacity by about one million  vehicles  by  mid-decade  to
          realign capacity with market conditions.

     o    Hourly  workforce:  About 12,000 hourly employees in North America are
          affected  by  actions  completed  in  December  2001  or to  be  taken
          throughout 2002 and beyond.  An additional 3,000 hourly employees were
          affected  in 2001.  Plans are being  made to  reassign  as many  plant
          employees as possible.


<PAGE>

Item 1. Business (Continued)

     o    Salaried workforce: Our 2001 voluntary separation program for salaried
          employees  and  other  related  actions  resulted  in  a  3,500-person
          workforce reduction in North America. This program will be extended to
          achieve an additional  1,500-person  salaried  workforce  reduction to
          reach  the  goal  of  5,000.  If  necessary  to  meet  this  goal,  an
          involuntary separation program will be used.

     o    Global  workforce:  More than  35,000  employees  will be  affected by
          combined actions around the world by mid-decade. These include: 21,500
          in North  America - 15,000  hourly,  5,000  salaried  and 1,500 agency
          employees - and 13,500 in the rest of the world.

     o    Material costs: A material  cost-reduction  program has been initiated
          with North American  suppliers which shares design savings,  with Ford
          receiving 65 percent of  implemented  cost  reductions  and  suppliers
          receiving 35 percent in the first year. Designs will be developed that
          will help  improve our  products and overall  quality.  This  program,
          along with other  material  cost  reduction  efforts,  is  expected to
          improve   ongoing  annual  profits  before  taxes  by  $3  billion  by
          mid-decade.

     o    Discontinued  low-margin models: The Mercury Cougar, Mercury Villager,
          Lincoln Continental and Ford Escort will be discontinued this year.

     o    Beyond North  America:  Revitalization  plans  beyond  North  American
          automotive  operations  include the  continued  implementation  of the
          European   transformation   strategy,  the  Premier  Automotive  Group
          strategy,  the turnaround in South America and a revised direction for
          Ford Motor Credit Company.

     o    Divestitures:  We  are  pursuing  the  sale  of  non-core  assets  and
          businesses.  Our plan  includes  $1 billion of cash  realization  from
          these actions in 2002.


     Manufacturing  plans over the next several years  include:  1) closing five
plants:  Edison  Assembly,  Ontario Truck Plant,  St. Louis Assembly,  Cleveland
Aluminum  Casting and Vulcan Forge;  2) no new products have been identified for
two plants:  Ohio  Assembly  and  Cuautitlan  Assembly;  3) pursuing the sale of
Woodhaven  Forging Plant;  4) major  downsizing  and shift  reductions at eleven
plants;  and 5) line speed reductions and changes to operating  patterns at nine
plants.


                                Automotive Sector

     We  sell  cars  and  trucks   throughout  the  world.   In  2001,  we  sold
approximately 7 million vehicles  throughout the world.  Our automotive  vehicle
brands include Ford, Mercury,  Lincoln,  Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin
and TH!NK.  Substantially all of our cars, trucks and parts are marketed through
retail dealers in North America, and through distributors and dealers outside of
North  America.  At December 31,  2001,  the  approximate  number of dealers and
distributors  worldwide  distributing  our vehicle brands was as follows:  Ford,
over 13,000;  Mercury,  2,229;  Lincoln,  1,610; Volvo, 2,500; Jaguar, 694; Land
Rover,  2,300; Aston Martin, 81; TH!NK, 69. Because many dealerships  distribute
more than one of our brands from the same sales  location,  a single  dealership
may be counted under more than one brand in the previous sentence.

     The worldwide automotive industry, Ford included, is affected significantly
by a number of factors  over which we have  little  control,  including  general
economic  conditions.  In  the  United  States,  the  automotive  industry  is a
highly-competitive,  cyclical  business  that  has a  wide  variety  of  product
offerings.  The  number  of cars and  trucks  sold to  retail  buyers  (commonly
referred to as "industry  demand") can vary  substantially from year to year. In
any year,  industry demand depends largely on general economic  conditions,  the
cost of purchasing and operating cars and trucks,  and the availability and cost
of credit and fuel.  Industry demand also reflects the fact that cars and trucks
are durable items that people generally can wait to replace.

                                       2

Item 1. Business (Continued)

     The  worldwide  automotive  industry  consists of many  producers,  with no
single dominant producer. Certain manufacturers,  however, account for the major
percentage  of  total  sales  within  particular  countries,   especially  their
countries  of  origin.  Most  of the  factors  that  affect  the  United  States
automotive industry and its sales volumes and profitability are equally relevant
outside the United States.

     The  worldwide  automotive  industry  also is affected  significantly  by a
substantial amount of costly governmental  regulation.  In the United States and
Europe, for example, governmental regulation has arisen primarily out of concern
for the environment,  for greater vehicle safety, and for improved fuel economy.
Many governments  also regulate local content and/or impose import  requirements
as a means of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, or influencing their
balance of payments.

     Our unit sales vary with the level of total  industry  demand and our share
of that industry  demand.  Our share is  influenced by how our products  compare
with  those  offered by other  manufacturers  based on many  factors,  including
price, quality, styling, reliability,  safety, and functionality. Our share also
is affected by our timing of new model introductions and manufacturing  capacity
limitations.  Our ability to satisfy changing consumer  preferences with respect
to type or size of vehicle and its design and  performance  characteristics  can
impact our sales and earnings significantly.

     The  profitability of vehicle sales is affected by many factors,  including
the following:

     o    unit sales volume
     o    the mix of vehicles and options sold
     o    the margin of profit on each vehicle sold
     o    the level of "incentives" (price discounts) and other marketing costs
     o    the costs for customer warranty claims and other customer satisfaction
          actions
     o    the costs for  government-mandated  safety,  emission and fuel economy
          technology and equipment
     o    the ability to manage  costs
     o    the ability to recover cost increases through higher prices

Further,  because Ford and other  manufacturers  have a high proportion of costs
that are fixed  (including  relatively  fixed  labor  costs),  relatively  small
changes in unit sales volumes can  dramatically  affect  overall  profitability.
Therefore, should industry demand soften because of slowing or negative economic
growth in the major  markets in which we  operate,  or should our share of total
industry sales decline, our profitability will be adversely affected.  In recent
years,  industry  sales of  vehicles  in the United  States  have been at record
levels (17.5, 17.8 and 17.4 million units in 2001, 2000 and 1999  respectively).
In 2002,  however,  we expect  industry sales volumes in the United States to be
about  16.5  million  units  and we expect  to incur  significant  losses in our
Automotive segment in 2002.

     Following  is a  discussion  of the  automotive  industry in the  principal
markets where we compete,  as well as a discussion of our Ford Customer  Service
Division:

     We classify cars by small,  middle, large and luxury segments and trucks by
compact  pickup,   bus/van,   full-size  pickup,   sport  utility  vehicles  and
medium/heavy  segments.  The large and  luxury  car  segments  and the  bus/van,
full-size  pickup and sport utility vehicle segments include the industry's most

*In 1997 Ford sold its heavy truck businesses in North America and Australia/New
Zealand to Freightliner  Corporation.  Ford ceased production of heavy trucks in
North  America  in  December  1997.  The  transfer  of the  North  American  and
Australian heavy truck businesses was completed in 1998.

     As shown in the tables  above,  since 1997 there has been a shift from cars
to trucks for both industry sales and Ford sales. Ford's sales of the middle car
segment  as a  percentage  of its  total  sales has  deteriorated  more than the
general   decline  of  the  industry  sales  in  that  segment  because  of  the
discontinuance   of  certain  product  offerings  in  the  segment  (e.g.,  Ford
Thunderbird  and Contour and Mercury  Mystique) and, more recently,  lower fleet
sales of the Ford Taurus model.

*    All U.S. retail sales data are based on publicly available information from
     the media and trade publications.  ** Ford purchased Volvo Car on March 31,
     1999 and Land Rover on June 30, 2000.  The figures shown here include Volvo
     Car and Land  Rover on a pro  forma  basis for the  periods  prior to their
     acquisition  by Ford.  During the period from 1997 through 1998,  Volvo Car
     represented no more than 1.2 percentage points of total market share during
     any one year.  During the period 1997 through 1999, Land Rover  represented
     no more than 0.4  percentage  points of total  market  share during any one
     year.
***  Chrysler  and  Daimler-Benz  merged in late 1998.  The  figures  shown here
     combine  Chrysler and  Daimler-Benz  (excluding  Freightliner  and Sterling
     Heavy Trucks) on a pro forma basis for the periods prior to their merger.
**** "All  Other"  includes  primarily   companies  based  in  various  European
     countries, Korea and other Japanese manufacturers. The increase in combined
     market share shown for "All Others" reflects primarily  increases in market
     share for European  manufactures  (e.g., BMW) and the Korean  manufacturers
     (e.g., Hyundai and Kia).
*****"All  Other" in the U.S.  Truck  Market  Shares  table  includes  primarily
     companies  based in various  European  countries,  Korea and other Japanese
     manufacturers.  The  decrease  in combined  market  share from 2000 to 2001
     shown for "All Others" in this table reflects primarily decreases in market
     share for heavy truck manufacturers.
</TABLE>

     The decline in overall  market  share for Ford in 2001 and in Ford's  truck
market share since 1997 is primarily the result of increased competition and, in
particular, an increased number of new competitive product offerings mainly from
foreign manufacturers.

     Marketing  Incentives and Fleet Sales.  Automotive  manufacturers that sell
     -------------------------------------
vehicles in the United States typically give purchasers price discounts or other
marketing  incentives.  These  incentives are the result of competition from new
product offerings by manufacturers and the desire to maintain  production levels
and market  shares.  Manufacturers  provide these  incentives to both retail and
fleet customers  (fleet  customers  include daily rental  companies,  commercial
fleet  customers,  leasing  companies  and  governments).  Marketing  incentives
generally are higher during periods of economic downturns,  when excess capacity
in the industry tends to increase. We estimate that there exists presently about
five to six million units of excess capacity in North America.

     Our marketing costs for the Ford,  Lincoln and Mercury brands in the United
States as a percent of gross sales  revenue for those brands were as follows for
the three years indicated:  14.7% (2001), 11.1% (2000), and 10.6% (1999). In the
fourth quarter of 2001, our United States  marketing costs as a percent of gross
sales  revenue  for those  brands was 16.7%.  These  "marketing  costs"  include
primarily (i) marketing incentives on vehicles, such as retail rebates and costs
for special financing and lease programs,  (ii) reserves for costs and/or losses
associated with our required repurchase of certain vehicles sold to daily rental
companies,  and (iii) costs for advertising  and sales  promotions for vehicles.
The  increase  in  marketing  costs over the last  several  years is a result of
intense competition in the United States market.

     Fleet sales generally are less  profitable than retail sales,  and sales to
daily rental  companies  generally are less profitable than sales to other fleet
purchasers.  The mix between  sales to daily  rental  companies  and other fleet
customers has been about evenly split in recent years. The table below shows our
fleet sales in the United States,  and the amount of those sales as a percentage
of our total United States car and truck sales, for the last five years.

     Warranty  Coverage.  We presently  provide warranty coverage for defects in
     ------------------
factory-supplied  materials and  workmanship on all vehicles  (other than medium
trucks) in the United States.  This warranty coverage for Ford/Mercury  vehicles
extends  for 36 months or 36,000  miles  (whichever  occurs  first)  and  covers
components of the vehicle,  including tires  beginning  January 1, 2001 for 2001
and later model years.  Prior to January 1, 2001,  tires were  warranted only by
the tire  manufacturers.  The United States warranty coverage for 2002 and later
model years TH!NK Neighbor  vehicles extends for 36 months with unlimited miles.
The United States warranty coverage for luxury vehicles (Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo,
and Land Rover) extends for 48 months or 50,000 miles  (whichever  occurs first)
but, except for Lincoln beginning January 1, 2001, does not include tires, which
are warranted by the tire manufacturers. In general, different warranty coverage
is provided on medium  trucks and on vehicles  sold  outside the United  States.
Warranty  coverage for safety  restraint  systems  (safety  belts,  air bags and
related  components)  extends for 60 months or 50,000  miles  (whichever  occurs
first) and 60 months with  unlimited  miles for 2002 and later model years TH!NK
Neighbor vehicles.  Also,  corrosion damage resulting in perforation  (holes) in
body  sheet  metal  panels is  covered  on 1995 and newer  models  for 60 months
(unlimited  mileage).  In addition,  the Federal Clean Air Act requires warranty
coverage  for 8 years or 80,000 miles  (whichever  occurs  first) for  emissions
equipment (catalytic converter and powertrain control module) on most light duty
vehicles  sold in the United  States.  As a result of these  warranties  and the
concern  for  customer  satisfaction,  costs  for  warranty  repairs,  emissions
equipment repairs,  and customer  satisfaction actions ("warranty costs") can be
substantial. Estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at
the time of sale. Such accruals, however, are subject to adjustment from time to
time depending on actual experience.

Europe
------

     Market  Share  Information.  Outside  of the United  States,  Europe is our
     ---------------------------
largest  market for the sale of cars and  trucks.  The  automotive  industry  in
Europe is intensely competitive. Over the past year, we estimate that 145 new or
freshened vehicles,  including derivatives of existing vehicles, were introduced
in the European market by various manufacturers.  For the past 10 years, the top
six  manufacturers  have  collectively held between 73% and 77% of the total car
market,  and have each achieved a car market share in about the 9% to 19% range.
(Manufacturers' shares, however, vary considerably by country.) This competitive
environment is expected to intensify further as Japanese  manufacturers increase
their production capacity, and all of the manufacturers of premium brands (e.g.,
BMW,  Mercedes Benz and Audi)  continue to broaden their product  offerings.  We
estimate that in 2001 the European  automotive  industry had excess  capacity of
approximately  six million  units  (based on a comparison  of European  domestic
demand and capacity).

     In 2001,  vehicle  manufacturers  sold  approximately 17.8 million cars and
trucks in Europe,  about the same as 2000  levels.  Our  combined  car and truck
market share in Europe in 2001 was 10.7%,  up 7/10 of one percentage  point from
2000.

     Britain and Germany are our most important markets within Europe,  although
the Southern  European  countries  are becoming  increasingly  significant.  Any
adverse  change in the British or German market has a significant  effect on our
total European automotive  profits.  For 2001 compared with 2000, total industry
sales were up 10% in Britain and down 2% in Germany.

     For  purposes  of the figures  shown in this  section,  we have  considered
Europe to consist of the following 19 markets:  Britain, Germany, France, Italy,
Spain, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands,  Portugal, Switzerland,  Finland,
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, and Poland.

     Motor  Vehicle  Distribution  in Europe. On February 5, 2002,  the European
     ---------------------------------------
Commission  proposed a new  regulation  that would change the way motor vehicles
are sold and  repaired  throughout  the  European  Community.  While  Ford could
continue to maintain its "exclusive" distribution  arrangements that allow it to
provide dealers with exclusive sales territories,  the new rules would eliminate
the  presently  allowable  restrictions  on resale.  This means that our dealers
could sell vehicles to any reseller (e.g., supermarket chains, internet agencies
and  other  resellers  not  authorized  by us)  who in  turn  could  sell to end
customers  both within and outside of the dealer's  exclusive  sales  territory.
Alternatively,  manufacturers could establish a "selective"  distribution regime
that would allow the  manufacturer  to determine the number but not the location
of its  dealers.  Dealers  also  would  be free to set up  additional  sales  or
delivery  outlets  within the  European  Union and provide  active  sales to all
customers  within the European  Union,  but not sell motor vehicles to resellers
not authorized by the manufacturer. Under both systems, the new rules would make
it easier for a dealer to display and sell multiple  brands in one store without
the need to maintain separate facilities.

     The Commission also has proposed  sweeping  changes to the repair industry.
Dealers could no longer be required by the  manufacturer to perform repair work.
Instead, dealers could subcontract the work to independent repair shops that met
reasonable criteria set by the manufacturer.  These "official" repair facilities
could  perform  warranty  and  recall  work,  in  addition  to other  repair and
maintenance work. While a manufacturer  could continue to require the use of its
parts in warranty and recall work,  the repair  facility could use parts made by
others that were of comparable quality for all other repair work.

     It is difficult  to quantify at this time the full impact of these  changes
on our European operations. The Commission,  however, has stated that it expects
the new rules to lead to  increased  competition  and a narrowing  of car prices
from country to country. The new rules, coupled with the introduction of the new
single currency, are likely to put downward pressure on prices for both vehicles
and vehicle parts. Our existing dealer agreements will be modified by October 1,
2003 when the new rules are expected to apply.

Other Markets
-------------

     Mexico and Canada.  Mexico and Canada also are important markets for us. In
     -----------------
2001, industry sales of new cars and trucks in Mexico were approximately 948,000
units, up  approximately 7% from 2000 levels.  In Canada,  industry sales of new
cars and trucks in 2001 were approximately 1.59 million units, up 0.7% from 2000
levels.  Our combined  car and truck  market share in these  markets in 2001 was
17.3% (Mexico) and 16.6% (Canada).

     South  America.  Brazil and Argentina  are our  principal  markets in South
     --------------
America. The economic environment in those countries has been volatile in recent
years,  leading to large  variations in industry  sales.  Results have also been
influenced  by the  devaluation  of  the  Brazilian  Real  and  Argentina  Peso,
continued weak economic  conditions and government  actions to reduce  inflation
and public deficits. Industry sales in 2001 were 1.6 million units in Brazil, up
about 10% from 2000, and approximately 201,000 units in Argentina, down 41% from
2000.  Our combined car and truck market share in these markets in 2001 was 7.8%
in Brazil  (down 1.3% from last year) and 14.3% in  Argentina  (down 0.6% from a
year ago).

     Ford has  undertaken  restructuring  actions in recent years to improve our
competitiveness  in South America.  In addition,  we are building a new assembly
plant in Brazil,  which will  manufacture a new family of vehicles for the South
American  markets.  The new plant will start  building the 5-door  Fiesta in the
spring of 2002 and begin producing an all-new sport utility vehicle next year.

     Asia Pacific. In the Asia Pacific region,  Australia,  Taiwan, Thailand and
     ------------
Japan are our principal markets. Industry volumes in 2001 in this region were as
follows:  approximately  773,000  units in  Australia  (down  1.9%  from  2000),
approximately  347,400  units in Taiwan  (down 17.4% from  2000),  approximately
297,000  units in Thailand  (up 13.4% from 2000) and  approximately  5.9 million
units in Japan (down 1.0% from 2000). In 2001, our combined car and truck market
share in Australia was 15.1%. In Taiwan,  we had a combined car and truck market
share in 2001 of 14.9%. In Thailand, our combined car and truck market share was
6.5% in 2001.  Our  combined  car and truck  market share in Japan has been less
than 1% in recent years. We own a 33.4% interest in Mazda Motor  Corporation and
account for Mazda on an equity basis.  Mazda's market share in Japan has been in
the 5% range in recent  years.  Our  principal  competition  in the Asia Pacific
region has been the Japanese  manufacturers.  We anticipate  that the continuing
relaxation of import  restrictions  (including duty  reductions)  will intensify
competition in the region.

     We opened a new assembly plant in India in 1999, launching an all-new small
car (the Ikon) designed  specifically  for that market.  In 2001,  approximately
14,800 Ikons were produced for sale in India. In addition,  India commenced sale
of Ikon CKD (completely knocked down) kits to Mexico and South Africa, exporting
28,150 CKD kits to these two countries in 2001. We expect India to become one of
our most important markets in Asia in the future.

     Africa.  In recent years, we have operated in the South African market as a
     ------
45% owner in the South African Motor Corporation (Pty.) Limited  ("SAMCOR").  In
2000, we increased our  ownership  interest in SAMCOR to 100% by purchasing  the
remaining 55% we did not previously own.  Subsequent to this purchase,  SAMCOR's
name was changed to Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa ("FMCSA").

     FMCSA assembles and distributes Ford, Mazda,  Volvo and, beginning in 2001,
Land Rover  vehicles in South  Africa.  In addition,  FMCSA  distributes  Jaguar
vehicles.  In 2001,  industry volume in South Africa was  approximately  367,000
units, up 7.6% from 2000 levels.  FMCSA's combined car and truck market share in
2001 was 15.1% for the five brands it distributes.

Ford Customer Service Division
------------------------------

     Ford Customer Service Division is a business unit within Ford that supports
customers  of Ford,  Lincoln and  Mercury  brand  vehicles  through a network of
franchised dealers. This is the principal source of vehicle service and customer
support for our vehicle owners within these brands,  traditionally recognized by
the Quality  CareSM brand.  Ford Customer  Service  Division's  first,  and most
critical,  role within the organization is to provide the service parts,  tools,
technology & support to facilitate  the dealer network to achieve high levels of
customer service  satisfaction and owner loyalty.  Beyond the traditional  Ford,
Lincoln and Mercury  Dealerships,  Ford  Customer  Service  Division  also works
together  with the other Ford  trustmark  brands to optimize our dealer  service
business and share best practices.

     Ford Customer Service Division was part of our former  Automotive  Consumer
Services   Group  that  also   included  the   Diversified   Consumer   Services
Organization.  That  organization  contains  businesses that provide services to
vehicle owners for all  automotive  brands.  As part of our  RevitalizationPlan,
discussed below under Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of  Operations,"  we plan to focus primarily on our dealer
network for traditional  vehicle service and customer support.  In addition,  we
will decrease our involvement in selected businesses in our Diversified Consumer
Services  organization  -- we have  announced that we are evaluating the sale or
partial  disposition  of  Kwik-Fit,  our European  maintenance  and light repair
business,  Collision Team of America,  a U.S. chain of collision  repair centers
and  GreenLeaf  LLC, a chain of  automotive  recycling  centers in the U.S.  and
Canada.

     Through Ford Customer Service  Division's  e-Business  initiatives,  we are
working to manage our business in real time. By linking  together our suppliers,
dealers and customers, we are able to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency
of the  service  business  throughout  the  value  chain.  One  of the  greatest
competitive  advantages  we can  provide to our dealers is the ability to easily
obtain information such as:

                o        Technical information from suppliers
                o        Parts distribution status

</TABLE>

     In 2001,  higher net credit losses resulted  largely from increases in Ford
Credit's volume of receivables, a conversion of collection activities from local
branch offices to regional service centers in the United States and Canada,  and
an overall decline in the economy in the United States.  During the last quarter
of 2001,  Ford  Credit  experienced  an increase  in account  delinquencies  and
vehicle repossessions

Item 1. Business (Continued)

reflecting  significantly  weakening  economic  conditions  in the United States
following  the terrorist  attacks on September  11, 2001. As a result,  in 2001,
Ford Credit  increased its allowance for credit losses by $1.2 billion  compared
with 2000 year-end levels.

     In response to higher credit losses,  Ford Credit implemented the following
actions in 2001:

     o    Refined its pricing and  financing  policies to reduce its exposure to
          higher risk financing contracts,
     o    Increased  service center staffing  levels,  improved  training of new
          collectors, and enhanced segmentation strategies, and
     o    Initiated further improvements in bankruptcy  predictors and portfolio
          monitoring processes.

     Ford Credit requires  substantial funding in the normal course of business.
Ford Credit's funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to (i) purchase
retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of Ford
products,  which to a large  extent are  influenced  by  Ford-sponsored  special
financing  and leasing  programs  that are  available  exclusively  through Ford
Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations.

     Funding  sources for Ford  Credit  include  the sale of  commercial  paper,
issuance of term debt, the sale of  receivables  and, in the case of Ford Credit
Europe, the issuance of certificates of deposits to diverse investors in various
markets.  The  ability of Ford  Credit to obtain  funds is  affected by its debt
ratings,  which are closely related to the outlook for, and financial  condition
of, Ford and the nature and  availability of support  facilities.  The long-term
senior  debt of each of Ford,  Ford  Credit and Ford  Credit  Europe is rated as
follows by the three agencies that provide ratings:

                                      Ford    Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe
                                      ----    ----------------------------------

        Standard & Poor's             BBB+                      BBB+

     The commercial paper of each of Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe is rated
"F2" (by Fitch, Inc.), "Prime-2" (by Moody's), and "A-2" (by S&P).

     Under a profit maintenance  agreement with Ford Credit,  Ford has agreed to
make payments to maintain Ford Credit's earnings at certain levels. In addition,
under a support  agreement  with Ford Credit  Europe,  Ford Credit has agreed to
maintain Ford Credit  Europe's net worth above a minimum level. No payments were
made under either of these agreements during the period 1998 through 2001.

funding  strategies,  see  Item 7.  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations".  For a discussion of how Ford

     Between  April  1997 and  March  2001,  we owned  approximately  82% of the
economic  interest  of Hertz,  with the  remaining  approximately  18%  interest
represented by shares of Hertz common stock that were publicly traded.  In March
2001,  through a cash tender  offer and a merger  transaction,  we acquired  the
publicly  held  shares  and,  as  a  result,   Hertz  has  become  an  indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford.




                             Governmental Standards

     A number of  governmental  standards  and  regulations  relating to safety,
corporate  average fuel economy  ("CAFE"),  emissions  control,  noise  control,
damageability,  and theft  prevention  are  applicable  to new  motor  vehicles,
engines,  and equipment  manufactured for sale in the United States,  Europe and
elsewhere.  In addition,  manufacturing  and assembly  facilities  in the United
States,  Europe and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards  regulating air
emissions,  water  discharges,  and  the  handling  and  disposal  of  hazardous
substances.  Such facilities in the United States and Europe also are subject to
comprehensive national,  regional,  and/or local permit programs with respect to
such matters.

     Mobile Source Emissions Control -- U.S. Requirements. The Federal Clean Air
     -------------------------------
Act imposes stringent limits on the amount of regulated pollutants that lawfully
may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines produced for sale in the United
States.  Currently,  most light duty  vehicles  sold in the United  States  must
comply  with these  standards  for 10 years or 100,000  miles,  whichever  first
occurs.   The  U.S.   Environmental   Protection  Agency  ("EPA")  recently  has
promulgated  post-2004  model year  standards  that are more  stringent than the
default  standards  contained in the Clean Air Act. These new  regulations  will
require most light duty trucks to meet the same emissions standards as passenger
cars by the 2007 model year.  The stringency of the new standards may impact our
ability to produce and offer a broad range of products with the  characteristics
and functionality  that customers  demand.  The new standards also are likely to
limit severely the use of diesel technology,  which could negatively impact fuel
economy performance.  The EPA also has promulgated  post-2004 emission standards
for  "heavy-duty"  trucks  (8,500-14,000  lbs.  gross  vehicle  weight).   These
standards are likely to pose technical challenges and may affect the competitive
position of full-line vehicle manufacturers such as Ford.

     Pursuant to the Clean Air Act,  California  has  received a waiver from the
EPA to establish its own unique emissions  control  standards.  New vehicles and
engines sold in  California  must be certified by the  California  Air Resources
Board ("CARB").  CARB's emissions  requirements  (the "California  program") for
model  years 1994  through  2003  require  manufacturers  to meet a  non-methane
organic gases fleet average  requirement  that is  significantly  more stringent
than that prescribed by the Clean Air Act for the corresponding periods of time.
In late 1998, CARB adopted stringent new vehicle  emissions  standards that must
be phased in beginning in the 2004 model year.  These new  standards  treat most
light duty trucks the same as passenger  cars and require both types of vehicles
to meet new stringent emissions requirements. It is also expected that these new
standards will essentially  eliminate the use of diesel  technology.  CARB's new
standards present a difficult engineering and technological  challenge,  and may
impact our  ability  to produce  and offer a broad  range of  products  with the
characteristics and functionality that customers demand.

Item 1. Business (Continued)

     Since  1990,  the  California   program  has  included   requirements   for
manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale "zero-emission vehicles" (the "ZEV
mandate").  The ZEV mandate  initially  required that a specified  percentage of
each manufacturer's vehicles produced for sale in California, beginning at 2% in
1998 and increasing to 10% in 2003,  must be  zero-emission  vehicles  ("ZEVs"),
which produce no emissions of regulated pollutants. In 1996, CARB eliminated the
ZEV mandate for the  1998-2002  model  years,  but retained the 10% mandate in a
modified form beginning with the 2003 model year. Around the same time,  vehicle
manufacturers  voluntarily  entered  into  agreements  with CARB to conduct  ZEV
demonstration programs.

     In January 2001, CARB voted to approve a series of complex modifications to
the ZEV mandate. These modifications require large-volume  manufacturers such as
Ford to produce "partial zero-emission vehicles" ("PZEVs") and/or ZEVs beginning
in  the  2003  model  year.   PZEVs  are  vehicles   certified  to  California's
"super-ultra-low  emission  vehicle"  ("SULEV")  tailpipe  standards,  with zero
evaporative emissions. Using a series of phase-in tables and credit adjustments,
the  number  of  ZEVs  required   under  the  modified   mandate  will  increase
substantially between 2003 and 2018. The California Office of Administrative Law
refused to approve these rules due to procedural  defects,  so the modifications
still have not been  finalized.  We anticipate that CARB will attempt to correct
the defects and finalize the rules in 2002.

     The Clean Air Act permits  other states that do not meet  national  ambient
air quality standards to adopt  California's motor vehicle emission standards no
later than two years before the affected  model year.  New York,  Massachusetts,
Vermont,  and Maine adopted the  California  standards  effective  with the 2001
model  year  or  before.  New  York,  Massachusetts,  and  Vermont  have  either
previously  adopted,  or indicated an intention  to adopt,  the  California  ZEV
mandate.  Maryland and New Jersey have laws requiring the adoption of California
standards if certain  triggers are met.  There are  problems  with  transferring
California  standards to  northeast  states,  including  the  following:  1) the
driving range of ZEVs is greatly  diminished in cold weather,  thereby  limiting
their  market  appeal;  and 2) the  northeast  states have  refused to adopt the
California  reformulated gasoline  regulations,  which may impair the ability of
vehicles to meet California's  in-use standards.  New York and Massachusetts are
in the  process  of  finalizing  rules  that give  manufacturers  the  option of
complying with the  California  ZEV mandate or with an alternative  program that
may make compliance  more feasible in those states;  it is likely that Ford will
choose the alternative  program.  It is anticipated  that Vermont will adopt the
latest version of the ZEV mandate once it becomes final in California.

     Battery electric  vehicles are the only  zero-emission  vehicles  currently
feasible for mass production.  Despite intensive  research  activities,  battery
technology  has not made the  major  strides  that were  projected  when the ZEV
mandate  was  originally  enacted  in  1990.  Battery-electric  vehicles  remain
considerably  more  costly  than  gasoline-powered  vehicles,  and  they  have a
relatively  short  driving  range before they must be  recharged.  These factors
limit the consumer appeal of battery-powered vehicles. Ford plans to comply with
the early years of the modified ZEV mandate  through sales of its TH!NK brand of
electric  vehicles,  along with one or more PZEV  models.  In the  longer  term,
however,  it is doubtful  whether the market will  support the number of battery
electric  vehicles called for by the modified ZEV mandate.  Fuel cell technology
may in the future enable production of ZEVs with widespread consumer appeal, but
commercially  feasible fuel cell technology appears to be a decade or more away.
Compliance with the ZEV mandate may eventually require costly actions that would
have a  substantial  adverse  effect on Ford's  sales  volume and  profits.  For
example,  we could be  required  to curtail  the sale of  non-electric  vehicles
and/or offer to sell electric vehicles well below cost. Other states may seek to
adopt CARB's ZEV mandate pursuant to the Clean Air Act,  thereby  increasing the
costs to Ford. Other  automobile  manufacturers,  along with some dealers,  have
filed suit in state and federal  court  seeking to eliminate  the ZEV mandate on
various procedural and substantive grounds.

     Under the  Clean Air Act,  the EPA and CARB can  require  manufacturers  to
recall and repair  non-conforming  vehicles.  The EPA,  through  its  testing of
production vehicles, also can halt the shipment of non-conforming vehicles. Ford
may be required to recall, or may voluntarily recall, vehicles for such purposes
in the future. The costs of related repairs or inspections  associated with such
recalls can be substantial.

Item 1. Business (Continued)

     European  Requirements.   European  Union  ("EU")  directives  and  related
legislation limit the amount of regulated  pollutants that may be emitted by new
motor  vehicles  and  engines  sold in the EU.  In 1998,  the EU  adopted  a new
directive on emissions  from passenger cars and light  commercial  trucks.  More
stringent  emissions  standards  applied  to new  car  certifications  beginning
January 1, 2000 and to new car  registrations  beginning January 1, 2001 ("Stage
III Standards").  A second level of even more stringent  emission standards will
apply  to new  car  certifications  beginning  January  1,  2005  and to new car
registrations  beginning January 1, 2006 ("Stage IV Standards").  The comparable
light  commercial  truck Stage III Standards  and Stage IV Standards  would come
into effect one year later than the  passenger car  requirements.  The directive
includes  a  framework  that  permits  EU  member  states  to  introduce  fiscal
incentives  to  promote  early  compliance  with  the  Stage  III and  Stage  IV
Standards. The directive also introduces on-board diagnostic requirements,  more
stringent evaporative emission  requirements,  and in-service compliance testing
and recall provisions for emissions-related defects that occur in the first five
years or 80,000  kilometers of vehicle life  (extended to 100,000  kilometers in
2005).  The  Stage IV  Standards  for  diesel  engines  are not yet  technically
feasible  and may impact  our  ability  to  produce  and offer a broad  range of
products with the  characteristics  and  functionality  that customers demand. A
related EU directive  was adopted at the same time which  establishes  standards
for cleaner fuels  beginning in 2000 and even cleaner  fuels in 2005.  The EU is
setting up a program to assess the need for further changes to vehicle  emission
and fuel standards after 2005.

     Certain  European  countries are  conducting  in-use  emissions  testing to
ascertain  compliance of motor  vehicles with  applicable  emissions  standards.
These  actions  could lead to recalls of  vehicles;  the future costs of related
inspection or repairs could be substantial.

     Motor Vehicle Safety -- U.S.  Requirements.  The National Traffic and Motor
     --------------------
Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the "Safety Act") regulates motor vehicles and motor
vehicle  equipment in the United States in two primary ways.  First,  the Safety
Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that
does not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by the
National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration  (the "Safety  Administration").
Meeting or exceeding many safety  standards is costly because the standards tend
to conflict with the need to reduce  vehicle  weight in order to meet  emissions
and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related
to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns.  There were
pending  before  the  Safety  Administration   approximately  32  investigations
relating to alleged  safety  defects in Ford vehicles as of February 28, 2002. A
manufacturer  also is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that they do
not comply  with a safety  standard.  Should  Ford or the Safety  Administration
determine that either a safety defect or a noncompliance  exists with respect to
certain  of  Ford's  vehicles,  the  costs  of such  recall  campaigns  could be
substantial.

     The Transportation  Recall Enhancement,  Accountability,  and Documentation
Act (the  "TREAD  Act") was  signed  into law in  November  2000.  The TREAD Act
establishes  new  reporting  requirements  for  motor  vehicles,  motor  vehicle
equipment,   and  tires,   including  reporting  to  the  Safety  Administration
information on foreign recalls and information received by the manufacturer that
may assist the agency in the identification of safety defects. The obligation of
vehicle  manufacturers  to provide,  on a cost-free basis, a remedy for vehicles
with an identified safety defect or non-compliance  issue is extended from eight
years to ten years by the new  legislation.  The Safety  Administration  is also
required  to develop a new dynamic  test on  rollovers  to be used for  consumer
information.  Potential  civil penalties are increased from $1,000 to $5,000 per
day for certain statutory violations,  with a maximum penalty of $15,000,000 for
a related series of violations.  Similar penalties are included for violation of
the reporting  requirements.  Criminal  penalties are introduced for persons who
make false statements to the government or withhold  information with the intent
to mislead the government about safety defects that have caused death or serious
bodily injury.  Currently,  there is substantial  rulemaking activity related to
several TREAD Act  requirements  and final rules are expected to be  promulgated
throughout 2002 creating significant  additional  regulatory burdens for vehicle
manufacturers.

     Foreign  Requirements.  Canada,  the EU, individual member countries within
the EU,  and other  countries  in Europe,  South  America  and the Asia  Pacific
markets also have safety  standards  applicable to motor vehicles and are likely
to adopt additional or more stringent standards in the future.

Item 1. Business (Continued)

     Motor  Vehicle  Fuel  Economy  -- U.S.  Requirements.  Under  federal  law,
     -----------------------------
vehicles must meet minimum Corporate Average Fuel Economy ("CAFE") standards set
by  the  Safety  Administration.   A  manufacturer  is  subject  to  potentially
substantial  civil  penalties if it fails to meet the CAFE standard in any model
year,  after taking into account all available  credits for the preceding  three
model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years.

     The law  established a passenger car CAFE standard of 27.5 mpg for 1985 and
later model years, which the Safety Administration believes it has the authority
to amend to a level it determines to be the maximum  feasible level.  The Safety
Administration  has  established  a 20.7 mpg CAFE  standard  applicable to light
trucks.

     Ford expects to be able to comply with the  foregoing  CAFE  standards,  in
some cases using credits from prior or  succeeding  model years.  In general,  a
continued  increase  in demand for larger  vehicles,  coupled  with a decline in
demand for small and middle-size vehicles could jeopardize our long-term ability
to maintain compliance with CAFE standards.

     The CAFE standards will likely increase in the near future.  Both the House
and Senate have passed  separate bills  directing the Safety  Administration  to
establish new fuel economy standards for upcoming model years. It is anticipated
that a measure similar to these bills will be enacted into law during 2002. Even
if  Congress   does  not  pass  such  a  law,  it  is  likely  that  the  Safety
Administration  will  use  its  existing  rulemaking   authority  to  promulgate
increases in light truck fuel economy standards.  The Safety  Administration has
recently  requested  public  comment  on the  advisability  and  feasibility  of
increasing light truck standards in the 2005-2010 time frame.

     Pressure  to  increase  CAFE  standards  stems in part from  concerns  over
greenhouse gas emissions,  which may affect the global climate.  With respect to
greenhouse  gas  emissions,  the Bush  administration  released a climate change
policy  initiative  in February  2002.  The Bush  administration  plan  stresses
voluntary measures and a cap-and-trade  program to stem the growth of greenhouse
gas  emissions.  The Bush  administration  also has  launched  the  Freedom  Car
initiative,  which  supports  research  for fuel  cell-powered  vehicles.  Other
nations continue to press for United States ratification of the so-called "Kyoto
Protocol,"  which  would  require  the United  States to reduce  greenhouse  gas
emissions by 7% below its 1990 levels.  The Kyoto  Protocol  does not  currently
have the support of either the Bush  administration or Congress.  Separately,  a
petition has been filed with the EPA requesting  that it regulate carbon dioxide
(CO2, a greenhouse  gas)  emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act.
EPA has  requested  public  comment on this petition but has not taken action to
date.  Some states,  including  California,  are also  proposing to regulate CO2
emissions from motor vehicles.

     If  significant  increases in CAFE  standards for upcoming  model years are
imposed, or if EPA or other agencies regulate CO2 emissions from motor vehicles,
Ford might find it  necessary  to take  various  costly  actions that could have
substantial adverse effects on its sales volume and profits.  For example,  Ford
might have to curtail  production  of larger,  family-size  and luxury  cars and
full-size light trucks,  restrict offerings of engines and popular options,  and
increase  market  support  programs for its most  fuel-efficient  cars and light
trucks.

     Foreign Requirements.  The EU also is a party to the Kyoto Protocol and has
agreed to reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions by 8% below their 1990 levels during
the 2008-2012  period.  In December  1997,  the European  Council of Environment
Ministers (the "Environment  Council") reaffirmed its goal to reduce average CO2
emissions  from new cars to 120 grams per  kilometer by 2010 (at the latest) and
invited  European  motor  vehicle  manufacturers  to negotiate  further with the
European Commission on a satisfactory voluntary  environmental agreement to help
achieve this goal.  In October 1998,  the EU agreed to support an  environmental
agreement with the European Automotive Manufacturers  Association (of which Ford
is  a  member)  on  CO2  emission   reductions  from  new  passenger  cars  (the
"Agreement").  The Agreement  establishes an emission target of 140 grams of CO2
per  kilometer  for the average of new cars sold in the EU by the  Association's
members in 2008. In addition,  the Agreement  provides that certain  Association
members  (including  Ford) will introduce models emitting no more than 120 grams
of CO2 per

                                       17

Item 1. Business (Continued)

kilometer in 2000, and establishes an estimated target range of 165-170 grams of
CO2 per  kilometer for the average of new cars sold in 2003.  Also in 2003,  the
Association will review the potential for additional CO2 reductions, with a view
to moving further toward the EU's objective.  The Agreement assumes (among other
things) that no negative measures will be implemented against diesel-fueled cars
and the full  availability  of improved  fuels with low sulfur  content in 2005.
Average  CO2  emissions  of 140  grams  per  kilometer  for new  passenger  cars
corresponds to a 25% reduction in average CO2 emissions compared to 1995.

     The Environment Council requested the European Commission to review in 2003
the EU's progress  toward reaching the 120 gram target by 2010, and to implement
annual  monitoring  of the average CO2  emissions  from new  passenger  cars and
progress toward achievement of the objectives for 2000 and 2003.

     In  1995,  members  of  the  German  Automobile  Manufacturers  Association
(including  Ford  Werke  AG) made a  voluntary  pledge to  increase  by 2005 the
average  fuel  economy of new cars sold in Germany by 25% from 1990  levels,  to
make regular reports on fuel consumption,  and to increase industry research and
development  efforts  toward  this  end.  The  German  Automobile  Manufacturers
Association has reported that the industry is on track to meet the pledge.

     Other European countries are considering other initiatives for reducing CO2
emissions  from  motor  vehicles.  Taken  together,  such  proposals  could have
substantial adverse effects on our sales volumes and profits in Europe.

     Japan has adopted automobile fuel consumption goals that manufacturers must
attempt to achieve by the 2000 model year. The consumption  levels apply only to
gasoline-powered  vehicles,  vary by vehicle weight,  and range from 5.8 km/l to
19.2 km/l.

     End-of-Life  Vehicle  Proposal -- The European  Parliament  has published a
     ------------------------------
directive  imposing an obligation on motor  vehicle  manufacturers  to take back
end-of-life  vehicles with zero or negative value registered after July 1, 2002,
and to take back all other  end-of-life  vehicles with zero or negative value as
of January 1, 2007,  with no cost to the last owner.  The Directive also imposes
requirements  on the  proportion  of the  vehicle  that  may be  disposed  of in
landfills and the proportion that must be reused or recycled  beginning in 2006,
and bans the use of certain  substances  in  vehicles  beginning  with  vehicles
registered  after July 2003.  Member states may apply these  provisions prior to
the dates mentioned above.

     Presently,  there  are  numerous  uncertainties  surrounding  the  form and
implementation  of  the  legislation  in  different  member  states,  especially
regarding manufacturers' responsibilities and the resultant expenses that may be
incurred.  Depending on the  individual  member  states'  legislation  and other
circumstances,  we may be  required  to accrue  the costs  represented  by these
regulations in our 2002 financial statements. The directive should not, however,
result in significant cash expenditures before 2007.

     Pollution  Control  Costs -- During the period 2002 through 2006, we expect
     -------------------------
to  spend  approximately  $391  million  on  our  North  American  and  European
facilities to comply with air and water  pollution  and hazardous  waste control
standards, which now are in effect or are scheduled to come into effect. Of this
total, we estimate spending approximately $73 million in 2002 and $93 million in
2003.

     In 2001, the average number of people we employed  increased  approximately
one percent.  The increase  reflects  the full year effect of  acquisitions  and
newly consolidated subsidiaries (Land Rover, Ford Motor Company Southern Africa,
Collision  Team of America).  The numbers  above  include  approximately  20,500
hourly employees of Ford who are assigned to Visteon Corporation,  and, pursuant
to our collective  bargaining  agreement with the United Automobile Workers (the
"UAW"),  remain Ford  employees.  Visteon  reimburses Ford for all costs to Ford
associated  with these  employees.  Most of our employees work in our Automotive
operations.

     For further information  regarding employment  statistics of Ford, see Item
6. "Selected  Financial Data" later in this Report.  For information  concerning
employee retirement benefits, see Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements at the end of this Report.

     Substantially  all of the hourly employees in our Automotive  operations in
the United States are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining
agreements.  Approximately  99%  of  these  unionized  hourly  employees  in our
Automotive segment are represented by the UAW.  Approximately 2% of our salaried
employees  are   represented   by  unions.   Most  hourly   employees  and  many
non-management  salaried employees of our subsidiaries outside the United States
also are represented by unions.

     We have entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the UAW that is
scheduled  to  expire  on  September  14,  2003.  We also  have  entered  into a
collective  bargaining  agreement with the Canadian  Automobile  Workers ("CAW")
that is scheduled  to expire on September  17,  2002.  Among other  things,  our
agreements  with the UAW and CAW provide for guaranteed  wage and benefit levels
throughout  their terms and provide for significant  employment  security.  As a
practical  matter,  these agreements  restrict our ability to eliminate  product
lines, close plants, and divest businesses.  These agreements can also limit our
ability to change  local  work  rules and  practices.  Our  Revitalization  Plan
assumes  full  compliance  with  our  obligations   under  existing   collective
bargaining agreements.  Negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements with
the UAW and CAW could result in our incurring  costs  different  than  currently
anticipated.

     We are or will be negotiating  new collective  bargaining  agreements  with
labor  unions  in Europe  (as well as Mexico  and Asia  Pacific)  where  current
agreements  will expire in 2002.  A  protracted  work  stoppage in Europe  could
substantially adversely affect Ford's profits.

     In  recent  years  we  have  not  had  significant  work  stoppages  at our
facilities,  but they have occurred in some of our suppliers' facilities. A work
stoppage  could occur as a result of disputes  under our  collective  bargaining
agreements  with  labor  unions  or  in  connection  with  negotiations  of  new
collective  bargaining  agreements,  which, if protracted,  could  substantially
adversely  affect our  business  and results of  operation.  Work  stoppages  at
supplier  facilities for labor or other reasons could have similar  consequences
if  alternate  sources of  components  are not readily  available.  Our Canadian
facilities,  which are covered by the CAW agreement  expiring in September 2002,
include  facilities that are the primary source of engines for many of our truck
and sport utility models, which are among our most profitable models. Therefore,
any protracted  work stoppage at our Canadian  facilities in connection with the
negotiation  of a new collective  bargaining  agreement with the CAW will have a
substantial adverse effect on our business.

Item 1. Business (Continued)

     In addition to our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, we entered
into a  separate  agreement  with  the UAW in  connection  with  the sale of our
Dearborn steel-making operations to Rouge Industries, Inc., then known as Marico
Acquisition  Corp.,  in  1989.  As part of the  sale,  employees  of our  former
steel-making  operations became employees of Rouge Steel Company, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Rouge Industries,  Inc. ("Rouge").  Pursuant to the UAW agreement,
we agreed  that  Rouge  hourly  employees  who,  at the time of the  sale,  were
represented by the UAW and met certain seniority  requirements  would be allowed
to return to Ford to work in one of our Rouge area  plants if they were laid off
by Rouge in the future as a result of a layoff of unknown duration,  a permanent
discontinuance  of  operations  by Rouge or a sale of the  assets of Rouge.  The
right to return  remains in effect with respect to each eligible  employee for a
period  equal to the  employee's  Ford  seniority  as of the date of the sale by
Ford.  Approximately 1,000 former Ford employees currently employed by Rouge are
covered by this agreement. In part to avoid the occurrence of one or more of the
triggering events described above, we have extended subordinated credit to Rouge
totaling  $90  million.  In its  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31,  2001,  Rouge  stated that it has  suffered  recurring  losses from
operations  and  negative  cash  flows that raise  substantial  doubt  about its
ability to continue as a going concern.




                      Engineering, Research and Development

     We conduct engineering,  research and development  primarily to improve the
performance (including fuel efficiency), safety and customer satisfaction of our
products,  and to develop new products.  We also have staffs of  scientists  who
engage in basic research. We maintain extensive engineering, research and design
facilities for these purposes,  including  large centers in Dearborn,  Michigan;
Dunton,  England; and Merkenich,  Germany.  Most of our engineering research and
development relates to our Automotive operating segment.

     During the last three years, we took charges to our consolidated income for
engineering,  research and  development  we sponsored in the  following  amounts
(restated for prior years to exclude Visteon): $7.4 billion (2001), $6.8 billion
(2000), and $6.0 billion (1999). Any customer-sponsored research and development
activities that we conduct are not material.







Item 2.  Properties
-------------------

     We own substantially all of our U.S. manufacturing and assembly facilities.
These  facilities  are  situated in various  sections of the country and include
assembly  plants,  engine plants,  casting plants,  metal stamping  plants,  and
transmission  plants.  We also own a  majority  of our sales  offices,  with the
remainder  being leased.  Most of our  distribution  centers and  warehouses are
leased (approximately 26% are owned).

     In  addition,  we  maintain  and  operate  manufacturing  plants,  assembly
facilities,  parts  distribution  centers,  and engineering  centers outside the
United States. We own substantially  all of the manufacturing  plants,  assembly
facilities,  and  engineering  centers.  The majority of our parts  distribution
centers  outside of the United  States are either  leased or provided by vendors
under service contracts.

     Our Automotive  segment operates  approximately 96 plants; 126 distribution
centers/ warehouses; and 53 engineering and research and development centers.

Item 2. Properties (Continued)

     In recent  years,  we have sold or  contributed  certain of our  automotive
assets to entities in which we are a joint venture partner. These joint ventures
operate  approximately  17 plants that formerly were operated by our  Automotive
segment.  Because we do not control these joint ventures,  but have  significant
influence over their operating and financial policies,  these joint ventures are
not  consolidated  with  us for  financial  reporting  purposes,  but  they  are
accounted  for in our financial  statements  using the equity  method.  The most
significant of these joint ventures are:


          o    Getrag  Ford  Transmissions  GmbH -- a 50/50 joint  venture  with
               Getrag  Deutsche  Venture  GmbH & Co. KG., a German  company,  to
               which we transferred our European manual transmission  operations
               in Halewood,  England, Cologne, Germany and Bordeaux, France. The
               Getrag  joint  venture  produces  manual  transmissions  for  our
               European vehicle  assembly  operations.  Ford currently  supplies
               most  of  the  hourly  and  salaried  labor  requirements  of the
               operations   transferred  to  the  Getrag  joint  venture.   Ford
               employees who worked at the manual  transmission  operations that
               were  transferred  at the  time  of the  formation  of the  joint
               venture  are leased to the joint  venture  from  Ford.  Employees
               hired in the future to work in these  operations will be employed
               directly by the joint  venture.  Getrag Ford  Transmissions  GmbH
               reimburses  Ford for the full  cost of the  hourly  and  salaried
               labor supplied by Ford.

          o    ZF Batavia L.L.C.  -- a joint venture  between Ford (49% partner)
               and ZF  Friedrichshafen  Germany  (51%  partner),  which owns and
               operates  our  former   Batavia,   Ohio  automatic   transmission
               business.  ZF Batavia  will  produce,  starting in 2003,  a Front
               Wheel Drive Continuously  Variable  Transmission (CVT) for use in
               certain Ford Motor Company  vehicles in North America and Europe.
               ZF Batavia also  produces a Front Wheel Drive  4-Speed  Automatic
               Transmission  that is currently used in the Ford Mondeo,  as well
               as in both the Ford Escape and the Mazda  Tribute.  Ford supplies
               part of the hourly  labor  requirements  to the ZF Batavia  plant
               consisting  primarily of Ford hourly  employees who worked at the
               plant  prior  to the  joint  venture  being  formed.  ZF  Batavia
               reimburses Ford for the full cost of the hourly labor.

          o    Tenedora  Nemak,  S.A.  de C.V. -- owns and  operates  our former
               Canadian castings operations and supplies engine blocks and heads
               to several of our engine plants. Tenedora Nemak, S.A. de C.V. was
               an existing  castings joint venture between Ford and a subsidiary
               of Alfa S.A. de C.V.,  a Mexican  conglomerate.  Ford  supplies a
               portion  of  the  hourly  labor   requirements  to  the  castings
               operation.  Tenedora Nemak, S.A. de C.V.  reimburses Ford for the
               full cost of the hourly  labor  supplied  by Ford.  We own 20% of
               this joint venture.


     The furniture, equipment and other physical property owned by our Financial
Services operations are not material in relation to their total assets.

     The facilities owned or leased by us or our subsidiaries and joint ventures
described above are, in the opinion of management, suitable and adequate for the
manufacture  and  assembly  of our  products  and will  continue  to be adequate
following the plant closings described above as part of our Revitalization Plan.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
--------------------------

     Various legal actions,  governmental  investigations  and  proceedings  and
claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us and
our  subsidiaries,  including,  but not  limited  to,  those  arising out of the
following:  alleged defects in our products;  governmental  regulations covering
safety,  emissions,  and fuel economy;  financial  services;  employment-related
matters;  dealer,  supplier, and other contractual  relationships;  intellectual
property rights;  product  warranties;  environmental  matters;  and shareholder
matters. Some of the pending legal actions are, or purport to be, class actions.
Some of the foregoing matters involve or may involve  compensatory,  punitive or
antitrust or other  multiplied  damage claims in very large amounts,  or demands
for recall campaigns,  environmental  remediation  programs,  sanctions or other
relief that,  if granted,  would  require very large  expenditures.  See Item 1.
"Business-Governmental Standards". We regularly evaluate the expected outcome of
product  liability  litigation  and other  litigation  matters.  We have accrued
expenses for probable  losses on product  liability  matters,  in the aggregate,
based on an analysis of historical litigation payouts and trends.  Expenses also
have been accrued for other litigation  where losses are deemed probable.  These
accruals  have  been  reflected  in our  financial  statements.  Following  is a
discussion of our significant pending legal proceedings:

Firestone Matters
-----------------

     Recall and National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  Matters.  On
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
August 9, 2000, Bridgestone/Firestone,  Inc. ("Firestone") announced a recall of
all Firestone ATX and ATX II tires (P235/75R15)  produced in North America since
1991 and  Wilderness  AT tires of that same  size  manufactured  at  Firestone's
Decatur,  Illinois  plant.  Firestone  estimated  that about 6.5  million of the
affected tires were still in service on the date the recall was  announced.  The
recall was announced following an analysis by Ford and Firestone that identified
a  statistically  significant  incidence  of tread  separation  occurring in the
affected tires. Most of the affected tires were installed as original  equipment
on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles.  This original recall was substantially
completed by the end of the first quarter 2001.

     The Safety Administration  investigated the tread separation matter both to
make a root cause assessment and to determine whether  Firestone's recall should
be expanded to include other Firestone  tires.  We actively  cooperated with the
Safety  Administration in their investigation.  As a result of our work with the
Safety  Administration  with regard to its  investigation  of the Firestone tire
recall and our own root cause  analysis,  we  announced  on May 22, 2001 that we
would replace all remaining  15, 16, and 17-inch  Firestone  Wilderness AT tires
(about 13 million tires) on our vehicles. This precautionary action was based on
our analysis of data on the actual road performance of these tires,  comparisons
with the  performance  of  comparable  tires by other tire  makers,  a review of
information  developed  by and  received  from the  Safety  Administration,  and
extensive laboratory and vehicle testing.

     As a result of its investigations,  the Safety Administration on October 4,
2001 issued its determination  that 3.5 million Wilderness AT tires manufactured
before May 1998,  which  tires  were  subject to our  replacement  program,  are
defective,  and said that Firestone had agreed to recall those tires.  About 2.5
million of the  defective  tires are estimated to have been in service as of May
2001 (when  Ford's  replacement  program was  announced),  and consist of 15 and
16-inch  Wilderness AT tires manufactured prior to May 1998 and supplied to Ford
as original equipment or sold as replacement equipment.

     On February 12, 2002, the Safety  Administration issued a report denying an
earlier  request for an  investigation  into the handling  and  stability of the
Explorer  after a tread  separation.  In its report,  the Safety  Administration
specifically  analyzed and rejected each of allegations made in the request. The
Safety  Administration  based its  denial on both a  technical  analysis  of the
steering  and  handling  of the  Explorer as well as a review of crash data that
indicated "no  significant  difference in the likelihood of a crash  following a
tread separation between Explorer vehicles and other compact SUVs."

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

     Firestone   Tire   Related   Litigation.   In  the   United   States,   the
     ---------------------------------------
above-described  defect in certain Firestone tires, most of which were installed
as original  equipment on Ford  Explorers,  has led to a  significant  number of
personal  injury and class action  lawsuits  against Ford and  Firestone.  These
cases are described in detail below.

     Firestone Personal Injury Actions.  Plaintiffs in the personal injury cases
typically  allege  that their  injuries  were caused by defects in the tire that
caused it to lose its tread  and/or by defects in the  Explorer  that caused the
vehicle to roll over.  We are a  defendant  in these  actions  and,  as with all
litigation facing the Company,  are investigating the circumstances  surrounding
the  accidents and preparing to defend our product in the event we are unable to
reach reasonable resolution.

     Firestone Class Actions.  Five purported class actions are pending in which
plaintiffs  seek  to  represent  persons  who own (or at one  time  owned)  Ford
Explorers with Firestone tires: one in federal court in Indianapolis and four in
state courts in Pennsylvania,  Wisconsin,  South Carolina and Illinois. (A total
of about 96  Firestone-related  class actions were originally  filed, but almost
all of these  have been  consolidated  into the one case now  pending in federal
court in Indianapolis.) These actions were brought on behalf of persons who have
never been injured in an accident involving Firestone tires. They seek to expand
the scope of the recall to include  other  tires,  the cost of  replacing  those
tires, the alleged  diminution in vehicle value caused by the use of those tires
or by the  alleged  instability  of  Explorers,  or the amount by which Ford was
"unjustly  enriched" through inflated wholesale prices.  They also seek punitive
damages.

     In the federal  case,  our motion to dismiss that  complaint was granted in
part and  denied in part.  The court  ruled  that,  under the  National  Highway
Traffic  Safety Act, the Safety  Administration  has the exclusive  authority to
order and supervise automotive recalls.  Accordingly,  the court dismissed those
portions of the class action  complaints that sought recall of additional  tires
or court supervision of the recall and the tire replacement  program.  The court
also  dismissed  some of the claims for damages.  However,  the court refused to
dismiss the plaintiffs' warranty and unjust enrichment claims.

     On November 28, 2001,  the federal  court  certified a class  consisting of
"[a]ll  current  residents of the United States who either (a) owned or leased a
1991  through  2001 model year Ford  Explorer  as of August 9, 2000 . . . or (b)
owned or leased a 1991 through 2001 model year Ford Explorer  prior to August 9,
2000 . . ." The court  also  certified  a class  consisting  of  "[a]ll  current
residents of the United  States who owned or leased at any time from 1990 to the
present, vehicles that are or were equipped with Firestone ATX, ATX II, Firehawk
ATX, ATX 23 Degree,  Widetrack Radial Baja, and Wilderness tires; all tires that
are the same as Firestone  ATX, ATX II,  Firehawk ATX, ATX 23 Degree,  Widetrack
Radial Baja, and Wilderness tires but sold by Firestone under other brand names;
and  all  other  tires  manufactured  by  Firestone  that  are  the  same or are
substantially  similar to Firestone  ATX, ATX II,  Firehawk  ATX, ATX 23 Degree,
Widetrack Radial Baja and Wilderness  tires." The United States Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit has granted our petition to review this ruling.

     The state trial court in South Carolina has certified a class of all owners
of Wilderness  AT or ATX tires  installed on Ford  Explorers,  but our motion to
dismiss that case is still pending.

     Firestone  Shareholder   Derivative  Actions.  Two  shareholder  derivative
actions are pending  against the Board of Directors  with the Company named as a
nominal defendant.  Both actions are in Michigan,  one in state court and one in
federal  court.  The  actions  allege  that the  Board  members  breached  their
fiduciary duties to the Company and shareholders by failing to inform themselves
adequately regarding Firestone tires, failing to insure that the Explorer design
was safe,  failing to report  problems  with  Firestone  tires and to stop using
Firestone tires as original equipment, failing to recall all affected tires on a
global basis as soon as problems were known,  and mismanaging the recall once it
was announced.  The actions also allege breach of fiduciary  duties by the Board
with  respect  to the use of  distributor-mounted  thick film  ignition  ("TFI")
modules.  The plaintiffs  seek  injunctive  relief and damages,  a

                                       23

<PAGE>

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

return of all Director  compensation  during the period of the alleged  breaches
and attorneys  fees. By agreement of the parties the state court action has been
administratively  stayed pending the outcome of the federal court action. In the
federal court action, Ford has filed a motion to dismiss.

     Firestone  Securities Class Actions.  One purported nationwide class action
against the Company was filed in federal  court in Detroit  alleging  securities
fraud and  violations of Rule 10b-5 on behalf of all persons who purchased  Ford
stock during the period from March 1998 through  August  2000.  (Seven  separate
class action complaints were filed initially,  but all seven complaints have now
been replaced by one master  complaint.) The plaintiffs allege that, during that
period of time, the defendants made misrepresentations  about the safety of Ford
products and the Explorer in particular,  and failed to disclose  material facts
about  problems with Firestone  tires and the safety of Explorers  equipped with
Firestone   tires.   The   plaintiffs   claim   that,   as  a  result  of  these
misrepresentations  or omissions,  they purchased Ford stock at inflated  prices
and were  damaged  when the price of the stock  fell  upon  announcement  of the
recall and  subsequent  revelations.  On December 10, 2001 the federal  district
court granted  Ford's motion to dismiss and  dismissed the  consolidated  action
with  prejudice.  Plaintiffs  have  moved  to  amend  the  judgment  to make the
dismissal without prejudice and for leave to file an amended complaint.

     Venezuelan Matters.  In Venezuela,  the Attorney General's Office continues
     ------------------
to investigate  whether criminal  charges should be filed against  Firestone and
Ford employees as a result of tire tread  separation  accidents that occurred in
that country. The Venezuelan consumer protection agency (INDECU) is assisting in
this  investigation.   In  a  separate  investigation  being  conducted  by  the
Venezuelan  National  Assembly   concerning  the  cause  of  the  accidents,   a
preliminary  report was filed on  December 5, 2001 by the  Technical  Commission
appointed  to  conduct  the  investigation.  The  report  did  not  contain  any
conclusions  regarding  the cause of the  accidents;  it only  detailed the work
performed  by the  committee  up to  that  date.  It is not  clear  whether  the
committee will submit a final report.


Other Product Liability Matters
-------------------------------

     Asbestos Matters. Along with other vehicle manufacturers,  we have been the
     ----------------
target of  asbestos  litigation.  We are a  defendant  in  various  actions  for
injuries  claimed to have resulted from alleged  contact with certain Ford parts
and other products containing  asbestos.  Asbestos was used in brakes,  clutches
and other auto  components  from  1927-1997.  We no longer use  asbestos  in our
vehicles.

     Most of the asbestos litigation we face involves mechanics that worked with
brakes over the years,  although we have some cases that relate to the  presence
of  asbestos  in our  facilities.  In most of  these  cases  we are not the sole
defendant.  We believe we are becoming more aggressively targeted in these suits
as a result of the  bankruptcy  filings of companies that have been the previous
targets of asbestos  litigation.  As with all litigation facing the Company,  we
are  prepared  to defend  these  asbestos  related  cases.  We believe  that the
scientific  evidence confirms our long-standing  position that mechanics are not
at an  increased  risk of  asbestos  related  disease as a result of exposure to
asbestos used in the Company's vehicles.

     The  majority  of these  cases do not  specify a dollar  amount for damages
claimed and in many of those cases that do specify a dollar amount, the specific
amount referred to is only the jurisdictional  minimum. In any event, the actual
damages paid out to claimants  pursuant to adverse judgments or settlements have
historically  been only a small  fraction of the damages  claimed.  To date, our
annual  payout on these  cases has not been  material.  However,  trends  toward
larger jury verdicts and increased  awards of punitive  damages  create the risk
that the amounts actually paid to asbestos claimants may increase in the future.

                                       24

<PAGE>

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

Environmental Matters
---------------------

     General.   We  have  received  notices  under  various  federal  and  state
     -------
environmental laws that we (along with others) may be a potentially  responsible
party for the costs associated with  remediating  numerous  hazardous  substance
storage,  recycling or disposal sites in many states and, in some instances, for
natural  resource  damages.  We also  may have  been a  generator  of  hazardous
substances  at a number of other sites.  The amount of any such costs or damages
for which we may be held responsible could be substantial. The contingent losses
that we expect to incur in connection with many of these sites have been accrued
and those losses are  reflected in our financial  statements in accordance  with
generally  accepted  accounting   principles.   However,  for  many  sites,  the
remediation  costs and other damages for which we ultimately  may be responsible
are not reasonably  estimable  because of uncertainties  with respect to factors
such as our  connection to the site or to materials  there,  the  involvement of
other  potentially  responsible  parties,  the  application  of laws  and  other
standards  or  regulations,  site  conditions,  and  the  nature  and  scope  of
investigations,  studies,  and  remediation  to  be  undertaken  (including  the
technologies  to  be  required  and  the  extent,   duration,   and  success  of
remediation). As a result, we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the
amount of costs or other  damages for which we are  potentially  responsible  in
connection with these sites, although that total could be substantial.

     Waste Disposal.  The EPA initiated a civil enforcement  action against Ford
     --------------
as a result of Ford  Venezuela's  1997  shipment of  industrial  wastes from its
Valencia  Assembly  Plant in  Venezuela  for disposal in Texas.  Ford  Venezuela
shipped the  industrial  waste to the U.S. for disposal under the more stringent
U.S. disposal  requirements  because of the  unavailability of adequate disposal
facilities  in Venezuela and to ensure  proper  disposal of the waste.  Although
Ford  believes that the subject  waste is properly  classified as  non-hazardous
under U.S.  environmental  laws, the EPA contends that even if the wastes do not
exhibit any hazardous characteristics, they nevertheless may be the product of a
process that is automatically deemed hazardous under applicable regulations.  If
Ford is determined to have  violated EPA  regulations  regarding the disposal of
hazardous  wastes,  Ford  could be  required  to pay fines  which  could  exceed
$100,000.

     Ohio Assembly  Plant.  In September  1999, the EPA filed an  administrative
     --------------------
complaint  against Ford  alleging  violations of the Resource  Conservation  and
Recovery Act ("RCRA") at Ford's Ohio Assembly Plant. The alleged  violations are
related  to  Ford's  storage  of  hazardous  waste  and  the  absence  of a leak
monitoring program for paint equipment.  The count alleging failure to implement
a leak  monitoring  program for paint  equipment  remains  subject to discussion
between Ford and EPA.  Subsequent to the Ohio Assembly  enforcement action, Ford
has received  notices of  violation  alleging  the same  noncompliance  at other
facilities.  If Ford is determined to have violated EPA regulations,  Ford could
be  required to pay fines or take other  actions,  the  aggregate  cost of which
could exceed $100,000.

     Sale of E-450s in California. CARB has opened an investigation with respect
     ----------------------------
to approximately  375 1998 and 1999 model year E-450 vehicles sold to California
customers.  CARB  alleges  that these  vehicles  were sold  without the required
California  emissions  certification.  CARB  alleges that the sales were due, in
part,  to an  error  in  Ford's  ordering  process  for  the  E-450.  If Ford is
determined  to have  violated  CARB  regulations,  Ford could be required to pay
fines that could exceed $100,000. Discussions between CARB and Ford are ongoing.


Class Actions
-------------

     Paint Class Actions.  There are two purported class actions pending against
     -------------------
Ford in Texas and Illinois  alleging claims for fraud,  breach of warranty,  and
violations of consumer  protection  statutes.  The Texas case purports to assert
claims  on behalf of Texas  residents  who have  experienced  paint  peeling  in
certain 1984 through 1992 model year Ford  vehicles.  The Illinois case purports
to assert claims on behalf of residents of all states except Louisiana and Texas
who have  experienced  paint  peeling on most 1988  through 1997 model year Ford
vehicles.  Plaintiffs  in both cases  contend that their paint is defective  and
susceptible  to  peeling  because  Ford did not use  spray  primer  between  the
high-build  electrocoat  ("HBEC")  and the color coat.  The lack of spray primer
allegedly causes the adhesion of the color coat to

                                       25

<PAGE>

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

the HBEC to deteriorate  after extended  exposure to ultraviolet  radiation from
sunlight.  Plaintiffs in both cases seek unspecified compensatory damages (in an
amount to cover the cost of  repainting  their  vehicles and to  compensate  for
alleged diminution in value), punitive damages, attorneys' fees and interest.

     The Illinois case, Phillips, is still in the early stages of litigation and
                        --------
there have been no  significant  developments  in that case.  In the Texas case,
Sheldon, the trial court certified a class of Texas owners who experienced paint
-------
peeling because of the alleged defect.  On May 11, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court
reversed  the trial  court,  decertified  the class  and  remanded  the case for
further proceedings. On remand, the trial court certified two classes consisting
of original owners of class vehicles who experienced  peeling paint and original
owners who paid Ford or a Ford dealer to repaint their  vehicles.  We have filed
an appeal with the Texas Court of Appeals.

     TFI Module Class  Actions.  There are seven class actions  pending in state
     -------------------------
courts in Alabama,  California,  Illinois,  Maryland,  Missouri,  Tennessee  and
Washington,  alleging  defects in TFI  modules in more than 22 million  vehicles
manufactured  by Ford between 1983 and 1995.  With minor  variations  based upon
state law and differences in the scope of the classes alleged,  all of the cases
involve  the same  legal  claims  and  theories.  The  parties  have  reached an
agreement to settle the lead case in  California  and five of the other  pending
cases. The agreement provides that Ford will extend the warranties applicable to
distributor-mounted  TFI modules to 100,000 miles,  reimburse  class members who
previously paid to replace Motorcraft(R) distributor-mounted TFI modules, donate
$5  million to an  organization  for  research  and  education  in the fields of
automotive  safety or  environmental  protection,  and pay  plaintiffs'  counsel
reasonable fees and expenses.  The court in the California case gave preliminary
approval to the settlement. A final hearing on the settlement has been scheduled
for June 21, 2002. If the  settlement is approved by the California  court,  the
remaining five cases expressly  subject to the settlement  will be dismissed.  A
class certification motion is pending in the seventh case (in Illinois),  but if
the  nationwide  settlement is approved by the  California  court we expect that
case to be dismissed as well.

     Ford/Citibank  Visa Class Action.  Following the June 1997  announcement of
     --------------------------------
the termination of the Ford/Citibank credit card rebate program,  five purported
nationwide  class  actions and one purported  statewide  class action were filed
against Ford; Citibank is also a defendant in some of these actions. The actions
allege  damages in an amount up to $3,500  for each  cardholder  who  obtained a
Ford/Citibank credit card in reliance on the rebate program and who is precluded
from  accumulating  discounts  toward the purchase or lease of new Ford vehicles
after  December  1997 as a result  of the  termination  of the  rebate  program.
Plaintiffs  contend  that  defendants  deceptively  breached  their  contract by
unilaterally  terminating  the  program,  that  defendants  have  been  unjustly
enriched  as  a  result  of  the  interest   charges  and  fees  collected  from
cardholders, and further, that defendants conspired to deprive plaintiffs of the
benefits of their credit card agreement.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory  damages,
or  alternatively,  reinstatement of the rebate program,  and punitive  damages,
costs, expenses and attorneys' fees. The five purported nationwide class actions
were  filed  in  state  courts  in  Alabama,  Illinois,  New  York,  Oregon  and
Washington,  and the purported  statewide class action was filed in a California
state court. The Alabama court has conditionally certified a class consisting of
Alabama  residents.  Ford  removed  all of the  cases to  federal  court,  which
consolidated  and  transferred  the cases to  federal  court in  Washington  for
pretrial  proceedings.   In  October  1999,  the  federal  court  dismissed  the
consolidated  proceedings for lack of jurisdiction  and sent each action back to
the state court in which it  originated.  We appealed  this ruling to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth  Circuit,  which affirmed the trial court.
The United  States  Supreme  Court has  granted  Ford's  petition  for a writ of
certiorari and will review the decision of the Ninth Circuit. We do not expect a
decision from the Court until at least the fourth quarter.

     Lease  Residual  Class Action.  In January 1998, in connection  with a case
     -----------------------------
pending in Illinois state court, Ford and Ford Credit were served with a summons
and  intervention  counterclaim  complaint  relating  to Ford  Credit's  leasing
practices  (Higginbotham  v. Ford Credit).  The  counterclaim  plaintiff,  Carla
            ----------------------------
Higginbotham,  is a member of a class that has been conditionally  certified for
settlement  purposes in Shore v. Ford  Credit.  In the Shore  case,  Ford Credit
                        ---------------------          -----
commenced an action for deficiency against Virginia Shore, a Ford Credit lessee.
Shore  counterclaimed  for  purported  violations  of the  Truth-in-Leasing  Act
(alleging that

                                       26

<PAGE>

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

certain lease charges were  excessive)  and the  Truth-in-Lending  Act (alleging
that the lease  lacked  clarity).  Shore  purported  to represent a class of all
similarly situated lessees. Ford was not a party to the Shore case. Higginbotham
                                                        -----
objected to the proposed  settlement  of the Shore case,  intervened  as a named
                                             -----
defendant,  filed separate counterclaims against Ford Credit, and joined Ford as
an additional counterclaim  defendant.  Higginbotham asserts claims against Ford
Credit for violations of the Consumer Leasing Act, seeks a declaratory  judgment
concerning the  enforceability of early termination  provisions in Ford Credit's
leases, and asserts fraud. She also asserts a claim against Ford Credit and Ford
for   conspiracy  to  violate  the   Truth-in-Lending   Act.  The   Higginbotham
                                                                    ------------
counterclaims allege that Ford Credit inflates the residual values of its leased
vehicles,  which results in lower monthly lease payments but higher  termination
fees for lessees who  exercise  their right of early  termination.  Higginbotham
claims that the early  termination  fees were not  adequately  disclosed  on the
lease form and that the fees are excessive and illegal  because of the allegedly
inflated  residual  values.  She also  alleges  that Ford  dictated the residual
values to Ford Credit and thereby participated in an unlawful  conspiracy.  This
case was stayed pending the  approval/rejection of the settlement in Shore. Ford
                                                                     -----
Credit has reached individual settlements with the Shore plaintiffs.
                                                   -----

     The Illinois court in Higginbotham  found that the lease end residual value
                           ------------
of Ms.  Higginbotham's  vehicle  was  properly  valued  and,  as a  result,  Ms.
Higginbotham was an inadequate representative for the class.  Subsequently,  Ms.
Higginbotham   voluntarily  dismissed  her  intervention   counterclaim  without
prejudice in the Illinois  state court and has  reactivated  her initial suit in
the Florida federal court,  pursuing  substantially  similar claims on behalf of
herself and others similarly  situated.  Consequently,  the Higginbotham case is
                                                            ------------
proceeding  in  Florida.  In  addition,  Ford  Credit  has filed a  response  to
plaintiff's  motion  for class  certification  and has  renewed  its  motion for
summary judgment based on information obtained in discovery.

     Retail Lessee Insurance  Coverage Class Action.  On May 24, 1999,  Michigan
     ----------------------------------------------
Mutual  Insurance  Company was served with a purported class action complaint in
federal court in Florida  alleging that the Ford Commercial,  General  Liability
and Business  Automobile  Insurance Policy,  and the Personal Auto Supplement to
that  policy,  provides  uninsured/underinsured  motorist  coverage  and medical
payments  coverage  to retail  lessees  of Ford  vehicles  (e.g.,  to Red Carpet
lessees).  The Company is required to defend and indemnify  Michigan Mutual. The
complaint  rests on an untenable  interpretation  of the Michigan Mutual policy,
which  was  intended  to cover  company  cars  and  lease  evaluation  vehicles.
Unfortunately,  however,  the Florida Court of Appeals in a prior action brought
by a single individual,  has accepted plaintiffs'  interpretation of the policy.
The Florida court's opinion should not be controlling in federal court, however,
and Ford has filed a motion for summary  judgment  based on the policy  language
and the  intention  of the  parties.  Plaintiffs  responded  to  Ford's  motion,
cross-moved for summary judgment in their favor, moved to amend their complaint,
and moved for  class  certification.  A  hearing  on Ford's  motion  was held on
October 2, 2000, and we expect a decision sometime in 2002.

         Throttle Body Assemblies Class Action. A purported nationwide class
         -------------------------------------
action is pending in federal court in Ohio on behalf of all persons who own or
lease 1999 Mercury Villagers. The complaint alleges that the vehicle has a
defective throttle body assembly that causes the gas pedal to intermittently
lock or stick in the closed position. The complaint alleges breach of warranty,
negligence, and violation of consumer protection statutes. Plaintiffs seek an
order requiring Ford to recall the vehicles. They also seek unspecified
compensatory damages, treble damages, attorneys fees, and costs. Plaintiffs'
motion to certify a class is pending.

     Windstar  Transmission  Class  Actions.  Two  purported  class  actions are
--------------------------------------
pending,  alleging  that  Ford  marketed,  advertised,  sold,  and  leased  1995
Windstars in a deceptive manner by misrepresenting  their quality and safety and
actively  concealing  defects  in the  transmissions.  One  case is  pending  in
California  state  court and is  limited to owners  and  lessees of that  state.
Another case is pending in Illinois state court and purports to represent owners
and lessees  from all  states.  Plaintiffs  contend  that  transmissions  in the
Windstar  have  prematurely  suffered from  shifting  problems and  acceleration
failures,  requiring  early  replacement at substantial  expense to owners.  The
cases assert several  statutory and common law theories,  and seek several types
of relief,  including unspecified  compensatory  damages,  punitive damages, and
injunctive  relief.  Plaintiffs' have filed a motion for class  certification in
the California case. (A third case, which alleged a defect in the  transmissions
of 3.8 liter engines in 1990-95

                                       27

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

Taurus/Sables and 1990-94 Lincoln Continentals in addition to 1995 Windstars has
been  dismissed.  Plaintiffs  have  appealed the  dismissal to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.)

     Seat Back Class Actions.  Four purported statewide class actions were filed
     -----------------------
in state  courts in  Maryland,  New  Hampshire,  New Jersey and New York against
Ford, General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler AG alleging that seat backs
with single recliner mechanisms are defective. Plaintiffs in each of these suits
alleged that seats installed in class vehicles  (defined as almost all passenger
cars made after  1991) are  defective  because the seat backs are  unstable  and
susceptible  to  rearward  collapse  in the event of a rear-end  collision.  The
purported  class in each state  consists of all persons who own a class  vehicle
and  specifically  excludes all persons who have suffered  personal  injury as a
result of the rearward  collapse of a seat.  Plaintiffs  allege causes of action
for negligence, strict liability, implied warranty, fraud, and civil conspiracy.
Plaintiffs  also allege  violations of the consumer  protection  statutes in the
various states.  Plaintiffs seek  "compensatory  damages measured by the cost of
correcting  the defect,  not to exceed  $5,000 for each class  vehicle."  Ford's
motions to dismiss were granted in Maryland,  New  Hampshire,  and New York, and
Ford's motion for summary judgment was granted in New Jersey.  The New Hampshire
Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's  ruling,  but  plaintiffs'  appeals are
pending in New York, Maryland, and New Jersey.

     Late Charges Class Actions.  A purported  state-wide class action was filed
     --------------------------
in state court in Maryland (Simpkins v. Ford Credit) in which the plaintiffs are
                            -----------------------
contending  that Ford Motor  Credit  Company's  late  charges on lease  accounts
violate state law. The  plaintiffs  allege that Ford Credit and PRIMUS  violated
the Maryland  Consumer  Leasing Act, the Maryland  Constitution and the Maryland
Consumer Code by charging late fees in consumer lease  transactions in excess of
6%. The  plaintiffs  assert that the maximum late fee allowed under Maryland law
is the judgment rate of interest,  which is 6% per annum. Plaintiffs are seeking
restitution,  punitive damages and injunctive  relief. We have filed a motion to
dismiss.

     Fair Lending Class Action. Ford Credit has been served with three purported
     -------------------------
class actions alleging that its pricing practices are discriminatory. One (Jones
                                                                           -----
v. Ford Credit) was filed in federal  court in New York,  another  (Rodriquez v.
--------------                                                      ------------
Ford  Credit)  was filed in federal  court in Illinois  and the last  (Lucena v.
------------                                                           ---------
PRIMUS) was filed in federal court in Pennsylvania.  The Jones case alleges that
------                                                   -----
our pricing  practices  discriminate  against African  Americans.  Specifically,
plaintiffs  allege that  although  Ford  Credit's  initial  credit risk  scoring
analysis applies  objective  criteria to calculate the risk-related  "Buy Rate,"
Ford Credit then  authorizes  dealers to impose a  subjective  component  in its
credit  pricing  system - the  Mark-up  Policy - to impose  additional  non-risk
charges.   It  is  the  alleged   subjective   mark-up  that  plaintiffs  allege
discriminates  against  African  Americans.  Ford Credit's motion to dismiss was
denied and the parties are  preparing for trial.  Rodriquez  and Lucena  involve
                                                  ---------      ------
similar  allegations but with respect to Hispanic Americans.  In Rodriquez,  the
                                                                 ---------
court denied our motion to dismiss and we expect the plaintiffs to file a motion
for class certification. In Lucena, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily
                            ------
dismiss the case without prejudice,  which was granted. We expect the plaintiffs
to re-file the case.  Ford and Ford Credit  believe that Ford  Credit's  pricing
practices are fair and are not discriminatory.

     F-150  Radiator  Class  Actions.  Two  purported  class actions are pending
     -------------------------------
alleging  that the Company  defrauded  purchasers  of 1999-2001  F-150 trucks by
falsely representing that certain option packages included "upgraded" radiators.
Approximately  400,000  trucks that were intended to have larger  radiators were
built with standard radiators. The first case, filed in state court in New York,
purports  to  represent  a  nationwide  class,  and  seeks  an  order  requiring
installation of larger radiators and other damages.  The trial court granted our
motion to dismiss,  and plaintiffs have appealed.  In the second case,  filed in
state court in Texas, the trial court has certified a class of all purchasers of
2000 and 2001 F-150  trucks with heavy duty or trailer  packages  in Texas,  and
seeks  unspecified  damages.  We are appealing that ruling to the Texas Court of
Appeals. Plaintiffs' motion to modify the certification ruling to expand it to a
nationwide class is pending in the trial court.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

     Platinum  Group Metals. A purported  nationwide class action has been filed
     ----------------------
against the Company in federal court in New York alleging  securities  fraud and
violations  of Rule  10b-5 on behalf of all  persons  who  purchased  Ford stock
between  December  1, 1999 and  January  12,  2002  (the  "class  period").  The
plaintiff alleges that during the class period the Company entered into a series
of contracts for the purchase of platinum group metals  ("PGM") at  historically
high prices and failed to properly hedge these  purchases,  thereby exposing the
Company to losses  when the price of PGM fell.  The  plaintiffs  allege that the
Company  made  statements  in its  securities  disclosures  about its  commodity
purchase  practices  and hedging  programs  that misled  investors  as to Ford's
exposure to loss from PGM purchases.  As a result,  plaintiffs  allege that they
purchased Ford stock at inflated prices and were damaged when Ford  "wrote-down"
the value of its PGM by $1 billion on a pre-tax basis.

     Side Release Seat Belt Buckles.  On February 14, 2002, Ford was served with
     ------------------------------
a purported  class action  alleging that the side release  buckles  installed in
1969 through 1998 Ford vehicles are defective  because they "could  unlatch from
inertial  forces." The suit was filed in state court in Illinois against General
Motors Corporation as well as against Ford,  allegedly on behalf of all Illinois
owners of vehicles with the defective buckles.  The complaint seeks compensatory
and  punitive  damages,  including a payment to each class member of the cost of
installing different buckles.


Other Matters
-------------

     Rouge Powerhouse Insurance  Litigation.  There are several pending lawsuits
     --------------------------------------
arising out of the February 1, 1999 Rouge  Powerhouse  explosion.  In June 2000,
Ford filed a coverage  action against ten property  insurance  carriers  seeking
property damage and business  interruption losses attributable to the Powerhouse
explosion.  Factory Mutual,  one of these insurers,  filed a counterclaim in the
lawsuit for claims paid to Rouge Steel Company ("Rouge Steel"). Factory Mutual's
counterclaim  alleges that Rouge Steel's damages  occurred as a result of Ford's
negligence,  gross negligence or willful and wanton  misconduct in operating the
Powerhouse  and totals  approximately  $340 million.  This  counterclaim,  and a
similar claim for  approximately  $25 million by other  insurers of Rouge Steel,
has been  ordered to  arbitration.  Additionally,  claims  related  to  business
interruption  losses  incurred by several  suppliers  to Rouge  Steel,  totaling
approximately $20 million, also have been added to the arbitration. In addition,
seventeen Ford employees and two Rouge Steel  employees also have filed lawsuits
seeking  recovery  in  excess  of $100  million  in the  aggregate  for  alleged
psychological injuries caused as a result of the explosion.

     Visteon Dispute.  As reported in the media,  Ford and Visteon  Corporation,
     ---------------
our former automotive  components subsidiary that was spun-off on June 28, 2000,
have been attempting to resolve certain  disputes that arose out of the spin-off
related to the  pricing of  components  sold by  Visteon  to Ford.  The  primary
disputes  related  to (i)  the  amount  of  Ford's  contractual  entitlement  to
productivity  price  reductions  for the year 2001,  and (ii) Ford's  ability to
adjust  downward the price of business  sourced to Visteon in Europe at the time
of the spin-off over the years 2001-2005. We have negotiated a resolution of the
first matter in respect of North America, and Visteon is pursuing arbitration of
the second matter.

* New York Stock Exchange composite interday prices as provided by the
www.NYSEnet.com price history database. All prices and dividends prior to August
9, 2000 have been adjusted to reflect the effects of our recapitalization, known
as the Value Enhancement Plan ("VEP"), which became effective at that time, and
all prices prior to June 28, 2000 have been adjusted to reflect the spin-off of
Visteon Corporation, our former automotive components subsidiary, completed on
that date.

     For a  discussion  of  recent  dividend  actions  taken  by  our  board  of
directors,  see Item 7.  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition  and  Results  of  Operations-Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources-Total
Company."

     As of February 26, 2002,  stockholders  of record of Ford included  184,938
holders of Common Stock (which number does not include  30,925 former holders of
old Ford Common  Stock who have not yet tendered  their  shares  pursuant to the
VEP) and 111 holders of Class B Stock.

     During  2000  and  1999,  we sold  500,520  shares  and  1,001,513  shares,
respectively,  of our  Common  Stock  in  private  transactions  that  were  not
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  These transactions were
exempt from registration requirements because they were private placements under
Section 4(2) of the Securities  Act of 1933, as amended.  These shares were sold
in  several,   unrelated  transactions  to  owners  of  automotive  dealerships,
automotive  recycling  businesses,  and other  businesses  in exchange for those
businesses. The consideration we received for the shares was equal to the market

FOURTH QUARTER 2001 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Our worldwide losses, including charges of $4,106 million primarily related
to our  Revitalization  Plan, were $5,068 million in the fourth quarter of 2001,
or $2.81 per diluted share of Common and Class B Stock. In the fourth quarter of
2000,  earnings were $1,077 million (including charges for unusual items of $133
million),  or $0.57 per diluted share.  Worldwide  sales and revenues were $41.2
billion in the fourth quarter of 2001, down $1.4 billion,  reflecting  primarily
lower vehicle sales in North America,  partially  offset by higher vehicle sales
in Europe.  Unit sales of cars and trucks  were  1,808,000  units,  down  32,000
units,  reflecting primarily lower market share in the United States,  partially
offset by higher market share in Europe.

</TABLE>

     These substantially non-cash charges included $3.9 billion and $204 million
for the Automotive sector and the Financial Services sector,  respectively.  The
Automotive-related  charge  included  asset  impairment  charges,  write-down of
precious metals and forward contracts related thereto, employee separation costs
(primarily for employees who voluntarily accepted separation offers in 2001) and
other charges,  such as an accounting  charge for Mazda pension  expense and the
impact of the devaluation of the Argentine peso. See Note 16 of the Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these charges.

     We expect  that the  effects of our  Revitalization  Plan will  improve our
pre-tax operating results to $7 billion annually,  an improvement of $9 billion,
by mid-decade.  This expectation is based on assumptions for the U.S. market for
2003 and beyond with  respect to industry  sales (16  million  units  annually),
Ford-brand market share (19%) and net pricing (negative).

     The  decrease in our fourth  quarter  Automotive  sector  earnings in North
America  reflected  primarily the asset  impairments and other charges  outlined
above, lower vehicle unit sales volumes, significantly increased marketing costs
for Ford,  Lincoln and Mercury brands (16.7% of sales compared with 10.7% a year
ago),  and an increase in warranty  and other  costs  associated  with  customer
satisfaction initiatives.

     The  improved  fourth  quarter  results in Europe  reflected an increase in
vehicle unit sales and the benefits of last year's  restructuring  actions.  The
decline in South America reflected  primarily asset  impairments  related to the
Revitalization  Plan and other charges,  lower operating results due to a weaker
currency in Brazil,  the  devaluation  of the Argentine  peso and lower industry
volumes in Brazil and Argentina.

     Ford  Credit's  consolidated  loss in the  fourth  quarter of 2001 was $297
million,  compared with earnings of $410 million in 2000.  This result  included
charges associated with the  Revitalization  Plan ($204 million) and the ongoing
impact of  Statement  of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 133 ($99
million).   The  Revitalization   Plan  charges  included  costs  for  strategic
partnering  actions in Brazil,  including  writedowns  and losses related to the
disposition  of  certain  assets  ($126  million);   government  initiatives  in
Argentina related to currency  devaluation and consumer debt ($65 million);  and
voluntary  employee  separation costs in North America ($13 million).  Excluding
these  charges  and the impact of SFAS No. 133,  Ford Credit  earned $6 million,
down $404 million from the same period a year  earlier.  The  reduction was more
than  accounted for by a higher  provision for credit losses ($913 million after
taxes in 2001 compared with $360 million in 2000), offset partially by favorable
volumes, margins and investment and other income related to securitizations. The
higher provision for credit losses was in response to

higher  credit  loss  experience  in the  fourth  quarter  of  2001,  reflecting
significant weakening economic conditions in the United States.

     Losses at Hertz in the fourth  quarter of 2001 were $58  million,  compared
with earnings of $56 million a year ago. The profit decline was primarily due to
the lower car rental volume in the United States,  reflecting the adverse impact
on business travel and pricing  following the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001 and the slowdown in the U.S. economy.

FULL-YEAR 2001 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Our  worldwide  sales and revenues were $162.4  billion in 2001,  down $7.7
billion from 2000,  reflecting  primarily  lower vehicle sales in North America,
offset  partially by higher vehicle sales in Europe.  We sold 6,991,000 cars and
trucks in 2001, down 433,000 units,  reflecting  primarily lower market share in
the United States, partially offset by higher market share in Europe.

2001 Compared with 2000
-----------------------

     Worldwide losses from continuing  operations for our Automotive sector were
$6,267  million in 2001 on sales of $131.5  billion,  compared  with earnings of
$3,624 million in 2000 on sales of $141.2 billion.  Adjusted for constant volume
and mix and excluding  unusual  items and costs  related to our  Firestone  tire
replacement  action,  our total costs in the  Automotive  sector  increased $1.0
billion compared with 2000.

     Our Automotive  sector losses from  continuing  operations in North America
were $5,597 million in 2001 on sales of $91.0 billion, compared with earnings of
$4,886 million in 2000 on sales of $103.9  billion.  The earnings  deterioration
reflected  primarily  lower vehicle unit sales volumes,  the charges  associated
with the Revitalization Plan and the other charges outlined above, significantly
increased  marketing costs, costs associated with the Firestone tire replacement
action  and  increased   warranty  and  other  costs  associated  with  customer
satisfaction initiatives.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations (Continued)

     In 2001,  approximately  17.5  million new cars and trucks were sold in the
United  States,  down from 17.8 million  units in 2000.  Our share of those unit
sales  was  22.8% in 2001,  down 0.9  percentage  points  from a year  ago,  due
primarily to increased  competition  resulting  from new model entrants into the
truck and sport utility vehicle segments,  as well as the continued  weakness of
the Japanese yen, which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our Japanese
competitors.  Marketing costs for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands increased
to  14.7%  of  sales  of those  brands,  up from  11.1% a year  ago,  reflecting
increased  competitive  pricing in the form of subsidized  financing and leasing
programs (such as 0.0% financing  during the fourth  quarter),  cash rebates and
other incentive programs.

     Our Automotive  sector earnings in Europe were $266 million from continuing
operations  in 2001,  compared  with  losses of $1,130  million a year ago.  The
increase  reflected  the  non-recurrence  of the 2000  charge  related  to asset
impairments and  restructuring,  as well as increased vehicle unit sales and the
effect on  depreciation  from last year's  asset  impairment  and  restructuring
actions.

     In 2001,  approximately  17.8  million new cars and trucks were sold in our
nineteen  primary  European  markets,  down from 17.9 million units in 2000. Our
share of those unit sales was 10.7% in 2001,  up 0.7  percentage  points  from a
year ago, reflecting increased sales of new Ford-brand Mondeo and Transit models
and our acquisition of Land Rover.

     Our  Automotive  sector  losses in South  America  were $777  million  from
continuing operations in 2001, compared with a loss of $240 million in 2000. The
decrease is more than explained by asset impairment  charges and the devaluation
of the Argentine peso.

     Industry sales in 2001 were 1.6 million units in Brazil,  up about 10% from
2000, and approximately 201,000 units in Argentina, down 41% from 2000. Brazil's
economy has  recently  entered  into a recession as a result of tight fiscal and
monetary policies and election year uncertainties, which have restrained growth.
We expect industry volumes in Brazil to deteriorate in 2002. Economic conditions
continue to remain weak in  Argentina  primarily  as a result of the recent peso
devaluation.  Our combined  car and truck market share in these  markets in 2001
was 7.8% in Brazil (down 1.3 percentage points) and 14.3% in Argentina (down 1.4
percentage points).

     Automotive sector losses from continuing  operations outside North America,
Europe, and South America ("Rest of World") were $159 million in 2001,  compared
with  earnings of $108  million in 2000.  The earnings  deterioration  reflected
Ford's share of a non-cash charge relating to Mazda's pension expenses and other
restructuring actions at Mazda.

     New car and truck sales in Australia,  our largest market in Rest of World,
were  approximately  773,000 units in 2001,  down about 14,000 units from a year
ago. In 2001,  our combined  car and truck market share in Australia  was 15.1%,
down 0.6 percentage points from 2000,  reflecting  primarily share deterioration
in the full-size car segment due to continued aggressive competition.

2000 Compared with 1999
-----------------------

     Worldwide  earnings from  continuing  operations for our Automotive  sector
were  $3,624  million in 2000 on sales of $141  billion,  compared  with  $4,986
million in 1999 on sales of $135  billion.  The  decrease in earnings  reflected
asset  impairments  and  restructuring  charges in Europe and lower  earnings in
North America,  offset partially by improved results in South America.  Adjusted
for constant  volume and mix, our total costs in the Automotive  sector declined
$500 million compared with 1999.

     Our Automotive sector earnings from continuing  operations in North America
were $4,886  million in 2000 on sales of $103.9  billion,  compared  with $5,418
million in 1999 on sales of $99.2 billion. The earnings deterioration  reflected
primarily  costs  associated  with the Firestone tire recall and higher warranty
costs related to our 3.8 liter engine, offset partially by increased volume. The
after-tax return on sales for our Automotive sector in North America was 4.8% in
2000, down 0.7 percentage points from 1999.

     In 2000,  approximately  17.8  million new cars and trucks were sold in the
United States, up from 17.4 million units in 1999. Our share of those unit sales
was 23.7% in 2000, down 0.1 percentage points from 1999.

     Our Automotive  sector losses in Europe were $1,130 million from continuing
operations  in 2000,  compared  with  earnings  of $50  million a year ago.  The
decline  reflected  primarily the second  quarter 2000 charge of $1,019  million
related to asset impairment and restructuring costs for Ford brand operations.

     In 2000,  approximately  17.9  million new cars and trucks were sold in our
nineteen  primary  European  markets,  down from 18.2 million units in 1999. Our
share of those unit sales was 10% in 2000, down 0.2 percentage points from 1999,
reflecting  primarily an increase in market share related to our acquisitions of
Volvo Car and Land Rover,  offset by a decrease in market  share for  Ford-brand
vehicles.  The decrease in our Ford brand share  reflected  primarily  continued
aggressive competition.

     Our  Automotive  sector in South America lost $240 million from  continuing
operations  in  2000,  compared  with  a loss  of  $444  million  in  1999.  The
improvement  reflected  primarily  higher  vehicle  margins  resulting from cost
reductions and improved product mix and pricing.

     In 2000, approximately 1.5 million new cars and trucks were sold in Brazil,
compared  with 1.3  million  in 1999.  Our share of those unit sales was 9.1% in
2000,  down 0.6  percentage  points  from  1999.  The  decline  in market  share
reflected increased competition.

     Automotive sector earnings from continuing  operations in the Rest of World
were $108 million in 2000, compared with earnings of $87 million in 1999.

     New car and truck sales in Australia,  our largest market in Rest of World,
were approximately  788,000 units in 2000,  essentially  unchanged from 1999. In
2000, our combined car and truck market share in Australia was 15.7%,  down 1.9
percentage points from 1999, reflecting primarily strong competitive pressures.

2001 Compared with 2000
-----------------------

     Ford Credit's  consolidated net income in 2001 was $839 million,  down $697
million  or 45%  from  2000.  Excluding  Ford  Credit's  share  of  the  charges
associated with the Revitalization  Plan and the ongoing impact of SFAS No. 133,
net income was $1.2 billion, down $336 million compared with 2000, due primarily
to a higher provision for credit losses,  offset partially by favorable earnings
effects related to  securitization  transactions,  higher  financing  volumes of
finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins.

      Total investment and other income
       related to securitization
       (excluding SFAS No. 133)                            $1,760              $  557                 $  433
</TABLE>

     Securitization  revenue includes the gains on sales of finance receivables,
as well as the interest earned on retained securities, servicing fee income from
sold  receiveables  that Ford  Credit  continues  to service,  and other  income
related to  interest-only  strips.  Interest-only  strips,  also  referred to as
excess  spread,  represent  Ford Credit's  right to receive  collections on sold
receivables  in  excess  of the  amount  needed to pay  principal  and  interest
payments to investors and servicing fees.

     Gains or losses on sales of  receivables  are  recognized  in the period in
which they are sold.  As shown  above,  in 2001 such  gains  were $412  million,
compared  with $14 million and $83 million in 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The
sale of receivables has the impact of reducing Ford Credit's  financing  margins
in the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years.  The net impact
of securitizations on Ford Credit's earnings in a given year will vary depending
on the amount,  type of receivable and timing of  securitizations in the current
year and the  preceding  two to three year period,  as well as the interest rate
environments   at  the  time  the  finance   receivables   were  originated  and
securitized.  The  following  table  shows  the  estimated  after-tax  impact of
securitization  for the years indicated,  net of the effect of reduced financing
margins resulting from the foregone earnings of sold receivables (in millions):

</TABLE>

     Because we do not expect another sharp decline in interest rates,  and Ford
Credit is planning to sell a smaller  amount of finance  receivables,  we do not
anticipate  that the gains on sales of  receivables  will  continue at the level
experienced  in  2001.  As a  result  of  the  large  increase  in  the  use  of
securitization  in 2001,  we also  anticipate  that there will be a  significant
unfavorable effect on Ford Credit's financing margin in 2002.

     Earnings at Hertz in 2001 were $23 million.  In 2000, Hertz had earnings of
$358  million.  The decrease in earnings was  primarily  due to lower car rental
volume in the United States,  reflecting  the adverse impact on business  travel
and pricing of the slowdown in the United States economy.

2000 Compared with 1999
-----------------------

     Ford Credit's  consolidated net income in 2000 was $1,536 million,  up $275
million or 22% from 1999. Compared with 1999, the increase in earnings reflected
primarily  improved net  financing  margins and a higher  level of  receivables,
offset partially by higher credit losses and operating costs.

     Earnings at Hertz in 2000 were $358 million. In 1999, Hertz had earnings of
$336 million. The increase in earnings reflected primarily strong volume-related
performance,  offset  partially by downward pricing pressure and higher interest
costs.

     In 2001,  we spent $6.4  billion  for  capital  goods,  such as  machinery,
equipment, tooling, and facilities, used in our Automotive sector. This was down
$1.0  billion  from  2000,  reflecting  primarily  a reduced  number of  product
introductions.  Capital  expenditures  were  4.8% of  sales  in  2001,  down 0.4
percentage points from a year ago.

     The $4.6 billion improvement in working capital in 2001 reflected primarily
lower  receivables  ($2.2  billion in 2001  compared with $4.7 billion in 2000),
resulting  largely from  implementation of Ford's best practices for receivables
management  (mainly at Volvo and Land Rover) and inventory  improvements  across
much of the company ($6.2 billion in 2001 compared with $7.5 billion in 2000).

     Dividends totaling $400 million were paid from Ford Credit to Ford in 2001.
However,  no  dividend  payments  were  made  in the  fourth  quarter  of  2001.
Additionally, in January 2002, $700 million of cash was contributed from Ford to
Ford Credit as additional  equity,  which  lowered Ford Credit's  debt-to-equity
ratio to 14.1 to 1 (calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from  securitized
funding as debt).

     In  2001,  we spent  $2.0  billion  for  acquisitions  of  other  companies
(primarily the final payment of $1.6 billion to AB Volvo for our  acquisition of
Volvo Car) and contributed $735 million to the Financial Services sector for the
purchase of the  minority  interest  in Hertz.  These  expenditures  were offset
partially  by  divestitures  (primarily  proceeds of about $400 million from the
sale of assets to our Getrag transmissions joint venture).

     In 2001,  we spent $1.8 billion for purchases of our common stock under our
$5 billion share repurchase  program ($1.2 billion) and our anti-dilutive  share
repurchase  program.  Issuances  of common stock in 2001,  reflecting  primarily
employee  stock  option  exercises,  resulted in the receipt of proceeds of $500
million.

     Debt and Net Cash - At December 31, 2001, our  Automotive  sector had total
     -----------------
debt of $13.8  billion,  up $1.7 billion  from a year ago. The weighted  average
maturity of this debt is  approximately  28 years, of which $902 million matures
by December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2001, our  Automotive  sector had net cash
(defined  as gross  cash less total of  long-term  debt and  current  portion of
long-term debt) of $3.9 billion, compared with $8.1 billion and $13.7 billion at
the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Credit  Facilities - At December 31, 2001, the  Automotive  sector had $8.6
     ------------------
billion of contractually  committed credit agreements with various banks;  87.4%
of this amount is available  through June 30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to
transfer,  on a  non-guaranteed  basis,  $7.4  billion and $598 million of these
credit lines to Ford Credit and Ford Credit Europe, respectively.

     Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities - On January 30, 2002, we
     -------------------------------------------------
sold 100 million shares of Cumulative  Convertible Trust Preferred Securities to
the public at a price of $50 per share,  for net  proceeds  (after  underwriting
commissions,  but before expenses) of $4,900,000,000.  The proceeds will be used
for general  corporate  purposes.  The preferred  securities were issued by Ford
Motor  Company  Capital  Trust  II,  the sole  assets  of which  are the  junior
subordinated  convertible debentures due January 15, 2032 of Ford Motor Company.
The preferred  securities  can be converted  into shares of Ford common stock at
any time at a conversion price of $17.70 per share. If converted,  the aggregate
amount of additional shares of Ford common stock that would be outstanding would
be about 282 million shares.


Financial Services Sector
-------------------------

     Ford Credit

     Debt and Cash - Ford Credit's total debt was $146.3 billion at December 31,
     -------------
2001,  equal to last year.  Outstanding  commercial  paper at December  31, 2001
totaled $15.7 billion at Ford Credit,  with an average remaining  maturity of 48
days. At December 31, 2001,  Ford Credit had cash and cash  equivalents  of $2.9
billion.  In the  normal  course of its  funding  activities,  Ford  Credit  may
generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate  funding needs. This
excess funding is referred to as  "overborrowings."  Of the $2.9 billion of cash
and cash equivalents, $1.9 billion represented these overborrowings.

     Funding - Ford Credit requires  substantial funding in the normal course of
     -------
business.  Ford Credit's  funding  requirements are driven mainly by the need to
(i) purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the
sale of Ford products,  which to a large extent are influenced by Ford-sponsored
special  financing and leasing programs that are available  exclusively  through
Ford Credit, and (ii) repay its debt obligations.

     Funding  sources for Ford  Credit  include  the sale of  commercial  paper,
issuance of term debt, the sale of  receivables  and, in the case of Ford Credit
Europe,  the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various
markets.

     Ford  Credit's  commercial  paper  issuances  are  used to meet  short-term
funding needs.  Ford Credit has commercial  paper programs in the United States,
Europe,  Canada and other  international  markets.  It reduced the amount of its
outstanding  global  commercial  paper from $42.3  billion at the end of 2000 to
$15.7  billion  ($13.8  billion net of  overborrowings)  at December 31, 2001 by
replacing such funding with term-debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables.
During 2002, Ford Credit plans to maintain its commercial  paper  outstanding at
levels of around $5 billion to $7 billion,  net of  overborrowings.  Ford Credit
also obtains short-term  funding through the issuance of variable

                                       49

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations (Continued)

denomination,  floating rate demand notes through its Ford Money Market  Account
program. At December 31, 2001, $4.0 billion of such notes were outstanding. Bank
borrowings  by Ford Credit's  foreign  affiliates  are an  additional  source of
short-term funding.

     Long-term funding requirements for Ford Credit are met through the issuance
of a variety  of debt  securities  underwritten  in both the  United  States and
international  capital  markets.  During 2001, Ford Credit issued  approximately
$40.3 billion of term-debt  with  maturities  of two to ten years.  During 2002,
Ford  Credit  plans to raise  $15  billion  to $20  billion  through  term  debt
issuances  and $15 billion to $20 billion  through  securitization  transactions
(excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper
programs),  which are  discussed  below.  Other  sources of funds  include  bank
borrowings, mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive.

     Beginning in 2000, Ford Credit modified its funding  strategy to reduce its
reliance on short-term funding. Ford Credit increased its use of selling finance
receivables in  securitization  transactions  because of its lower relative cost
(as described  below) and issued a larger amount of unsecured  long-term debt to
improve its liquidity.  Ford Credit will continue to use  securitization as long
as it  provides  added  funding  and remains  cost  efficient.  Ford Credit also
developed  additional  funding  sources and  capacity to maintain a  diversified
funding portfolio, such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset-backed
commercial paper programs.

     As a result of this  funding  strategy,  the decline in debt  ratings  Ford
Credit experienced in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material impact on its abilty
to fund operations and maintain liquidity, although its access to the commercial
paper market has declined. In 2002, Ford Credit's funding strategy will continue
to focus on  improving  liquidity  and making  diverse and  competitive  funding
sources available.  We believe that this funding strategy will allow Ford Credit
to  maintain  liquidity  through  difficult  economic  conditions.  Any  further
lowering of Ford Credit's debt ratings  would  increase its borrowing  costs and
potentially  constrain  certain funding  availability  from the capital markets.
This in turn  likely  would  cause Ford  Credit to rely more  heavily on funding
through   securitization   transactions.   However,  Ford  Credit's  ability  to
securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors:  the amount
and  credit  quality  of  receivables  available  to sell,  the  performance  of
receivables  sold in  previous  transactions,  general  demand  for the  type of
receivables Ford Credit offers,  and Ford Credit's debt ratings.  If as a result
of any of these or other factors, the cost of securitized funding  significantly
increased or  securitized  funding was no longer  available to Ford Credit,  its
liquidity would be adversely impacted.

     The cost of both  unsecured  term debt and funding  through  securitization
transactions is based on the margin (or spread) over a benchmark  interest rate,
such as the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  or  interest  rates  paid on U.S.
Treasury Notes of similar  maturities.  Spreads are typically  measured in basis
points,  where one basis point equals one  one-hundredth of one percent (0.01%).
The   relative   stability  of  spreads  for  funding   through   securitization
transactions   compared   with   unsecured   term-debt   funding   spreads   and
diversification   of  funding  sources  are  the  primary  reasons  Ford  Credit
securitizes  assets as a funding  source.  Since 1998,  the fixed rate spread on
Ford  Credit's  securitized  funding has been at a level between 48 and 99 basis
points above  comparable  U.S.  Treasury  rates,  while Ford Credit's  unsecured
term-debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as 50 basis points to over
264 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury rates.

     Over  the  last  year,  Ford  Credit  significantly  increased  its  use of
securitization transactions because, as discussed above, they have become a more
cost-effective  source of funds than unsecured financing sources. For 2001, 2000
and 1999, Ford Credit's proceeds from the sale of finance  receivables are shown
below (in billions):

     In addition,  in January of 2002 Ford Credit sold receivables  resulting in
$9.6 billion of proceeds.

     For additional  liquidity,  Ford Credit maintains  contractually  committed
credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled $14 billion at December
31, 2001,  including $4.5 billion available for Ford Credit Europe. The majority
of these  facilities  are available  through June 30, 2006 and $1 billion was in
use at December 31, 2001  (primarily by affiliates  outside of the United States
and  Europe).  In  addition,  Ford Credit and Ford  Credit  Europe may at Ford's
option use $7.4  billion and $598  million,  respectively,  of Ford's  committed
credit  facilities,  which also are available through June 30, 2006. At December
31,  2001,  banks also  provided  $12.5  billion of  facilities  to support Ford
Credit's asset-backed commercial paper program.

     Ford Credit also has entered into agreements  with several  bank-sponsored,
commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to
purchase from Ford Credit,  at Ford Credit's option, up to an aggregate of $12.4
billion of receivables.  These  agreements  have varying  maturity dates between
June 27, 2002 and December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6
billion of these commitments were utilized.

     Special Purpose  Entities - Ford Credit  regularly uses  securitization  to
     -------------------------
finance  its  operations.  Ford  Credit  securitizes  retail  installment  sales
contracts with the most frequency. Ford Credit also securitizes receivables from
Ford-franchised  dealers and non-Ford dealers representing loans used to finance
their  automobile  floorplan  inventories,  generally  referred to as  wholesale
receivables  or  floorplan  receivables.  Ford  Credit  occasionally  engages in
securitization of operating leases.

     In  a  typical  securitization,   Ford  Credit  sells  a  pool  of  finance
receivables to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary that
establishes  a  separate   special  purpose  trust  ("SPE")  and  transfers  the
receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued
by the trust.  Following  the transfer of the sold  receivables  to the SPE, the
receivables  are no longer  assets of Ford  Credit and the sold  receivables  no
longer appear on our balance sheet. The SPE issues interest-bearing  securities,
usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates,  secured
by future  collections on the sold  receivables  and related  collateral.  These
securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities, are structured into
senior and  subordinate  classes.  The senior  classes  have  priority  over the
subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also
benefit from other  enhancements such as over  collateralization,  excess spread
and cash reserve  funds.  These  securities  generally are rated by at least two
independent  rating  agencies  and sold in  registered  public  offerings  or in
private transactions exempt from registration under U.S. securities laws.

     Ford Credit uses SPEs in  securitization  transactions to achieve,  for the
benefit of securitization  investors,  isolation of the sold receivables so that
the  receivables  securing the securities  issued by the SPE would be beyond the
reach of Ford Credit's creditors.  The use of SPEs in this way allows the SPE to
issue highly-rated  securities in a highly-liquid and efficient market,  thereby
providing Ford Credit with a  cost-effective  source of funding.  The two-tiered
sale  of  receivables  to a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  and  then  to the  SPE is
conventional in the asset backed  securitization  market. Most of these SPEs are
classified  as  qualifying   special  purpose   entities   consistent  with  the
requirements  of SFAS  No.  140,  Accounting  for  Transfers  and  Servicing  of
Financial Assets and  Extinguishments  of Liabilities,  because of the nature of
the assets held by these  entities and the limited  nature of their  activities.
None of our or Ford Credit's  officers,  directors or employees holds any equity
interest in the SPEs or receives  any direct or indirect  compensation  from the
SPEs.  The SPEs do not own stock in either  Ford or Ford  Credit or any of their
affiliates.

     Ford  Credit  or  its  affiliates   often  retain  interests  in  the  sold
receivables.   The  retained  interests  may  include  senior  and  subordinated
securities,  restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPEs and  interest-only
strips.  Subordinated  securities  represent  lower rated  classes of securities
issued by the SPEs.  Restricted  cash is funded  initially by a small portion of
proceeds  from the sale of  receivables  that may be used to pay  principal  and
interest to SPE investors,  with unrestricted cash returned to Ford Credit after
investors  are fully  paid.  Interest-only  strips,  also  referred to as excess
spread,  represent  the  right  to  receive  collections  on  the  sold  finance
receivables in excess of amounts needed by the SPE to pay interest and principal
to  investors  and  servicing  fees.  The  retained  interests  serve as  credit
enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations (Continued)

     At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the total  outstanding  principal  amount of
receivables  sold by Ford  Credit  that was held by SPEs was $58.7  billion  and
$28.4 billion, respectively. At those dates, Ford Credit's retained interests in
such sold receivables were $12.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.

     Ford  Credit has no  obligation  to  repurchase  any sold  receivable  that
becomes  delinquent  in payment or otherwise  is in default.  The holders of the
asset-backed  securities have no recourse to Ford Credit or its other assets for
credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require Ford Credit
to repurchase  their  securities.  Ford Credit does not guarantee any securities
issued  by  SPEs.  However,  as  is  customary  in  asset-backed  securitization
transactions,  Ford Credit as the seller of the finance  receivables to the SPE,
is obligated to provide certain kinds of support. These support obligations fall
into three basic categories:

     Indemnification. Ford Credit is obligated to indemnify the SPE for breaches
of  representations  and  warranties  made  at  the  time  the  receivables  are
originally  transferred to the SPE, and certain tax liabilities  incurred by the
trust or the holder of the securities issued by the SPE.

     Receivable repurchase obligations.  The rating agencies specify eligibility
criteria  for  receivables  permitted  to be included in  securitizations.  Ford
Credit makes  representations  and warrants to the SPE that the sold receivables
meet the eligibility  criteria.  If a breach of any of our  representations  and
warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later  discovered,  the
SPE may require us to repurchase the non-conforming receivable from the SPE. The
repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest.

     Mandatory sale of additional receivables.  Ford Credit uses both amortizing
and revolving structures in its securitizations.  In most amortizing structures,
the SPE issues  securities that will receive  monthly  payments of principal and
interest and therefore amortize down as principal  collections are received.  In
revolving  structures,  the SPE  issues  securities  that only  receive  monthly
interest payments for a set period of time, called the revolving period,  before
receiving  repayments of principal.  Because the principal  amount of the issued
securities  remains  constant  during the  revolving  period while the principal
balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining, Ford Credit, as the
sponsor of the securitization  transaction, is required to replenish or "top up"
the SPE with new  receivables,  which are paid for by the SPE with proceeds from
principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period.

     In  addition,  in  connection  with  securitization  transactions,  the SPE
engages Ford Credit to collect and service the sold  receivables for a servicing
fee of 1% of the principal  amount of the  receivables.  As servicer of the sold
receivables, Ford Credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to
obligors if such  extensions and  adjustments  are consistent with our servicing
policies and  procedures.  However,  if Ford Credit makes material  changes to a
receivable,  including  changes to the interest  rate,  changes in the amount or
number of  monthly  payments  or  extensions  of the final  payment  date of any
receivable  beyond  certain  established  dates,  Ford  Credit  is  required  to
repurchase  the  affected  receivable  from the SPE at face value  plus  accrued
interest.


     Hertz

     Hertz requires  funding for the acquisition of revenue  earning  equipment,
which  consists of vehicles and  industrial and  construction  equipment.  Hertz
purchases this equipment in accordance  with the terms of agreements  negotiated
with automobile and equipment manufacturers. The financing requirements of Hertz
are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry.
Hertz's fleet size, and its related  financing  requirements,  generally peak in
the months of June and July,  and  decline  during the  months of  December  and
January. Hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations (Continued)

     Hertz  maintains  domestic and foreign  commercial  paper programs to cover
short-term  funding needs,  and also draws from bank lines, as a normal business
practice,  to fund international  needs. Hertz also is active in the medium-term
and long-term debt markets.

     During  2001,  Hertz  aligned its funding  strategy  with Ford  Credit's by
reducing its reliance on commercial  paper and  increasing  its use of long-term
funding  sources to improve  its  liquidity,  and is planning  on  launching  an
asset-backed securitization program during the second quarter of 2002.

     At December 31, 2001, Hertz had committed credit  facilities  totaling $3.4
billion.  Of this amount,  $2.6 billion  represents  global and other  committed
credit facilities ($1.1 billion of which are available through June 30, 2006 and
$1.6 billion of which have various maturities of up to four years); $200 million
consists of  seasonal  short-term  facilities;  and $500  million  consists of a
revolving credit line provided by Ford, which currently expires in June 2003.

Total Company
-------------

     Stockholders'  Equity  - Our  stockholders'  equity  was  $7.8  billion  at
     ---------------------
December 31, 2001,  down $10.8 billion  compared  with  December 31, 2000.  This
decrease  reflected  primarily net losses of $5.5 billion,  dividend payments of
$1.9  billion,   foreign  currency  translation   adjustments  of  $1.2  billion
(primarily reflecting weakening currencies in Europe), a net charge to equity on
derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133 of $1.1 billion
(primarily  foreign  currency  hedges and interest  rate swaps) and $1.2 billion
spent on share repurchases.

     Dividends and Share  Repurchases - In October 2001,  our board of directors
     --------------------------------
declared a fourth  quarter 2001  dividend on Ford's  common and Class B stock of
$0.15 per share,  which  represented  a 50%  reduction  from the $0.30 per share
dividend  that had been paid since the fourth  quarter of 2000.  On January  11,
2002, our board of directors  further  reduced the quarterly  dividend on common
and Class B stock by declaring a first quarter 2002 dividend of $0.10 per share,
which  represented a 33% reduction from the fourth quarter 2001 dividend.  These
dividend  reductions  will yield cash savings of nearly $1.5  billion  annually.
Also,  during 2001 we  purchased  $1.2  billion of our common stock under our $5
billion share repurchase program that had commenced in September 2000.  However,
in May 2001, we suspended share repurchases indefinitely.

     Debt  Ratings - Our  short-  and  long-term  debt are rated by three  major
     -------------
rating  agencies:  Fitch,  Inc.  ("Fitch");   Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc.
("Moody's");  and Standard & Poor's Rating  Services,  a division of McGraw-Hill
Companies, Inc. ("S&P"). In addition to these three rating agencies, we also are
rated in several  local  markets by locally  recognized  rating  agencies.  Debt
ratings  reflect  an  assessment  by the  rating  agencies  of the  credit  risk
associated  with  particular  securities we issue,  and are based on information
provided by us or other sources that rating agencies  consider  reliable.  Lower
ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital
markets.  Long- and  short-term  debt ratings of BBB- and F3 or higher by Fitch,
Baa3  and  P-3 or  higher  by  Moody's  and  BBB-  and A3 or  higher  by S&P are
considered  "investment grade." However, debt ratings are not recommendations to
buy,  sell, or hold  securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any
time by the  assigning  rating  agency.  Each rating  agency may have  different
criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company,  and therefore  ratings
should be evaluated independently for each rating agency.

     Fitch  Ratings.  On September 26, 2001,  Fitch  lowered the long-term  debt
ratings of Ford,  Ford Credit and Hertz from A+ to A- and lowered Ford  Credit's
and Hertz' short-term debt ratings from F1 to F2 with a negative outlook for all
entities. On January 11, 2002, Fitch lowered the long-term debt ratings of Ford,
Ford  Credit and Hertz from A- to BBB+,  confirmed  Ford  Credit's  and  Hertz's
short-term debt rating at F2, and confirmed the rating outlook for all companies
as negative.

     Moody's Ratings. On October 18, 2001, Moody's lowered Ford's long-term debt
rating from A2 to A3,  affirmed Ford Credit's long- and short-term  debt ratings
at A2 and  Prime-1,  respectively,  and  changed  the  rating  outlook  for both
companies  from  stable to  negative.  Moody's  also  lowered  Hertz'  long- and
short-term   debt  ratings  from  A3  to  Baa1  and  from  Prime-1  to  Prime-2,
respectively,  and changed its rating

outlook on Hertz to negative.  On January 16, 2002,  Moody's lowered Ford's long
term debt rating fromA3 to Baa1, lowered Ford Credit's long- and short-term debt
ratings from A2 to A3 and from Prime-1 to Prime-2,  respectively,  and confirmed
the rating  outlook of both  companies as negative.  Moody's also lowered Hertz'
long-term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, confirmed its short-term debt rating at
Prime-2 and confirmed its rating outlook as negative.

     S&P Ratings. On October 15, 2001, S&P lowered the long-term debt ratings of
Ford and Ford Credit  from A to BBB+,  lowered  Ford  Credit's  short-term  debt
rating from A-1 to A-2, and changed the rating  outlook for both  companies from
negative to stable.  S&P also lowered  Hertz's long- and short-term debt ratings
from A- to BBB and from A-1 to A-2, respectively, and changed its rating outlook
to stable. On January 11, 2002, S&P changed the rating outlook for all companies
to negative.

     Contractual  Obligations and  Commitments - For information  regarding debt
     -----------------------------------------
and  other  obligations  of  the  Automotive  and  Financial  Services  sectors,
including  amounts  maturing in each of the next five years,  see Note 11 of the
Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition, we, as part of our
normal business practices,  enter into long-term arrangements with suppliers for
purchases of certain raw materials,  components and services. These arrangements
may contain  fixed/minimum  quantity purchase  requirements.  We enter into such
arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services.


HERTZ PURCHASE

     In March 2001, through a tender offer and a merger transaction, we acquired
(for a total price of about $735  million) the common stock of Hertz that we did
not own, which  represented  about 18% of the economic  interest in Hertz.  As a
result, Hertz has become an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No.  141,  "Business  Combinations",  effective  for all  business  combinations
initiated  after June 30, 2001. The Statement  requires that the purchase method
of accounting be used for all business  combinations  and specifies that certain
acquired  intangible  assets in a business  combination  be recognized as assets
separately  from  goodwill  and  existing  intangible  assets  and  goodwill  be
evaluated for these new separation  requirements.  We do not expect  adoption of
this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated  financial position
or results of operations.

     We adopted SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January
1, 2002. Goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but
will be subject to an annual  impairment test. At year-end 2001, we had goodwill
of $6.6 billion and other  intangible  assets of $1.3 billion.  We are presently
evaluating the amount of the transitional  impairment,  which may range up to $2
billion  or more,  related  to  Kwik-Fit  and other  investments.  Goodwill  and
indefinite-lived intangible asset amortization of about $250 million after taxes
was charged to income in 2001.

     In June  2001,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  143,  "Accounting  for  Asset
Retirement  Obligations",  which requires entities to establish  liabilities for
legal obligations  associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets.
We will adopt the  Statement on January 1, 2003.  Although we are  assessing the
impact, we do not expect adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on
our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In  August  2001,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  144,  "Accounting  for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". This Statement superseded SFAS No.
121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of" and addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for
impairment of long-lived  assets to be held and used, and long-lived  assets and
components of an entity to be disposed of. We adopted this  Statement on January
1, 2002.  Although we are

assessing the impact,  we do not expect this Statement to have a material impact
on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Our  consolidated  financial  statements  are prepared in  conformity  with
United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these
financial statements requires the use of estimates,  judgments,  and assumptions
that affect the reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  at the date of the
financial  statements and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses  during
the periods presented.  The significant  accounting  principles which we believe
are the most important to aid in fully  understanding  our financial results are
the following:

     Product  warranties - estimated  warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us
are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer.  Estimates for warranty
costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included
in our  warranty  cost  accruals are costs for basic  warranties  on vehicles we
sell,  extended service plans (i.e.,  where customers pay a fee to have extended
warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period), product recalls and customer
satisfaction  actions  outside  the base  warranty.  An  example  of a  customer
satisfaction  action would be our Firestone tire replacement action begun in May
2001, in which we offered to replace 13 million Firestone tires installed on our
vehicles.  Warranty  cost  accruals are  adjusted  from time to time when actual
warranty claim experience differs from that estimated.

     Marketing  incentives - costs for customer and dealer cash  incentives  and
costs for special  financing and leasing  programs that we sponsor  through Ford
Credit (e.g., 0.0% financing  program) are recognized as sales reductions at the
later of the date the  related  vehicle  sales are  recorded  or at the date the
incentive program is both approved and communicated.  In general,  the amount of
financing  cost that we provide to Ford  Credit is the  difference  between  the
amounts offered to retail  customers and a market-based  interest or lease rate.
Costs for marketing  incentives are based upon assumptions  regarding the number
of vehicles  that will have a specific  incentive  applied  against them. To the
extent  the  actual  number of  vehicles  differs  from this  estimate,  or if a
different mix of incentives occurs, the marketing expense accruals are adjusted.

     Retirement benefits - our employee pension and other postretirement benefit
(i.e.,  health care and life  insurance)  costs and obligations are dependent on
our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions
include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, inflation, salary growth,
long-term  return on plan assets,  retirement  rates,  mortality rates and other
factors.  We base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at
year-end on AA-rated corporate long-term bond yields. Our health care cost trend
assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term  outlook,
and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Our inflation  assumption is based
on an evaluation of external market  indicators.  The salary growth  assumptions
reflect our  long-term  actual  experience,  the  near-term  outlook and assumed
inflation.  Retirement  and mortality  rates are based  primarily on actual plan
experience.  Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and
amortized over future periods and,  therefore,  generally  affect our recognized
expense and recorded  obligation in such future  periods.  While we believe that
the  assumptions  used  are  appropriate,   significant  differences  in  actual
experience or significant  changes in  assumptions  would affect our pension and
other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 17 of the Notes to
our Consolidated  Financial Statements for more information  regarding costs and
assumptions for employee retirement benefits.

     Impairment of long-lived assets - we periodically review the carrying value
of our long-lived  assets held and used and assets to be disposed of,  including
goodwill and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such
a review.  We evaluate the carrying  value of  long-lived  assets for  potential
impairment  on a  regional  operating  business  unit basis  using  undiscounted
after-tax  estimated cash flows or on an individual  asset basis if the asset is
held for sale. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements
for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of

                                       55

our North and South  American  Automotive  operations  in 2001 and our  European
Automotive operations in 2000.

     Allowance for credit losses - the allowance for credit losses  reflects our
estimate of losses  inherent in Ford Credit's  portfolio of finance  receivables
and operating  leases.  These losses result from obligors or lessees  failing to
timely make principal,  interest or lease  payments.  Our estimates are based on
several factors,  including prices of used vehicles,  loan-to-value  ratios, the
number of payments  remaining to be made on the obligation  (all of which affect
severity of loss) and  economic  conditions  and the credit risk  quality of the
portfolio  (both of which affect the frequency of defaults).  We monitor  credit
loss performance  monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit
losses quarterly.  When we determine an account to be  uncollectible,  we reduce
our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our
allowance  for credit  losses.  We increase our  allowance  for credit losses by
amounts we recover on finance  receivables  and lease  investments we previously
charged off as an  uncollectible  account.  For  information  regarding how Ford
Credit manages its credit loss risk, see Item 7A.  "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures  About  Market  Risk - Ford  Credit  Market and Other Risks - Credit
Risk."

     Depreciation  expense on operating  leases and residual  values - we have a
significant number of vehicles in Ford Credit's  operating lease portfolio.  Our
operating  lease  customers pay us fixed monthly rental  payments that we cannot
subsequently alter. At lease termination, our operating lease customers have the
opportunity of either  purchasing the vehicle for the lease-end  value specified
in their  lease  contract  or  returning  the  vehicle to us. We sell at auction
substantially all vehicles returned to us. We estimate the lease-end value based
on  a  proprietary   econometric  model  that  uses  historical  experience  and
forward-looking  information,  such as our new product plans, marketing programs
and quality  metrics.  We record  depreciation  expense for vehicles  subject to
operating leases on a straight-line  basis over the term of the lease in amounts
necessary to reduce the vehicle to its  estimated  residual  value at the end of
the lease term.  Accumulated  depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and
is included in our net investment in operating leases.

     Initially,  depreciation  expense is based on our  assessment  of lease-end
residual value at the time of contract origination.  Monthly, we monitor vehicle
line  performance  and,  quarterly,  we review the  adequacy of our  accumulated
depreciation  reserve. The most significant factors we examine to assess whether
adjustments are required are: lease  termination  volumes,  vehicle return rates
and expected used-car values at the end of the lease terms. If we determine that
modifications  are  necessary,   we  will  record   adjustments  to  accumulated
depreciation  through earnings over the remaining life of the affected  vehicles
in our portfolio.


OUTLOOK

Industry Sales Volumes and Financial Results
--------------------------------------------

Our outlook for car and truck (including heavy trucks) industry sales in 2002 in
our major markets is as follows:

     United States  --   approximately 16.5 million units, compared with the
                         17.5 million units sold in 2001
     Europe         --   approximately 16.9 million units, compared with the
                         17.8 million units sold in 2001 (both figures based on
                         nineteen markets)
     Brazil         --   approximately 1.4 million units, compared with the 1.6
                         million units sold in 2001
     Australia      --   approximately 790,000 units, compared with the 773,000
                         units sold in 2001

     Based on these and other assumptions (e.g., assumptions regarding marketing
costs,  which  are  expected  to be higher in  2002),  we expect  2002  earnings
(excluding unusual items) to be about breakeven,

                                       56

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations (Continued)

with the  Automotive  sector  incurring  significant  losses  and the  Financial
Services  sector  providing  offsetting  profits.  In  addition,  we expect  the
operating related changes in gross cash for the Automotive sector (calculated on
the basis described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Automotive Sector -
Gross Cash) to be negative in 2002.  Similar to the improvements in cost and the
other  expected  benefits  of the  Revitalization  Plan,  we expect  to  achieve
meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid-decade.


2002 Financial Milestones

     We have set and communicated  certain financial  milestones for 2002. While
we hope to achieve these goals,  they should not be interpreted as  projections,
expectations or forecasts of 2002 results. The financial milestones for 2002 are

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
--------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW

     We are  exposed  to a variety  of market  and other  risks,  including  the
effects of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  commodity  prices,
interest  rates, as well as risks to  availability  of funding  sources,  hazard
events,  and  specific  asset  risks.  These  risks  affect our  Automotive  and
Financial Services sectors differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as
an integral part of our overall risk management program,  which includes regular
reports to a central  management  committee that oversees global risk management
practices.  Our risk  management  program  recognizes  the  unpredictability  of
markets and seeks to reduce profit  volatility.  For more  information  on these
financial  exposures,  see  Notes  1 and 14 of  the  Notes  to our  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

     Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors also are exposed to liquidity
risk, or the  possibility of having to curtail their  businesses or being unable
to meet  present  and  future  financial  obligations  as they come due  because
funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable.  We, and particularly Ford
Credit,  which comprises  substantially  all of our Financial  Services  sector,
maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure  liquidity  through any economic
or business cycle. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources
include commercial paper, term debt, sale of receivables through  securitization
transactions, committed lines of credit from major banks, and other sources.

     We also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage
to property,  liability  claims,  and employee injury.  We protect against these
risks  through a  combination  of self  insurance and the purchase of commercial
insurance  designed to protect  against events that could  generate  significant
losses.

     The market and counterparty  risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit
are discussed and quantified below.


AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK

     Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts  denominated
in foreign currencies,  including the following: purchases and sales of finished
vehicles and production  parts, debt and other payables,  subsidiary  dividends,
and investments in affiliates.  These expenditures and receipts create exposures
to  changes  in  exchange  rates.  We also are  exposed  to changes in prices of
commodities used in our Automotive sector.

Foreign Currency Risk
---------------------

     Foreign currency risk is the possibility  that our financial  results could
be better or worse than  planned  because of changes in exchange  rates.  We use
derivative  instruments  to  hedge  assets,  liabilities  and  firm  commitments
denominated  in foreign  currencies.  Our  hedging  policy is designed to reduce
income  volatility  and is  based on  clearly  defined  guidelines.  Speculative
actions are not permitted.  In our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments
commonly used by  corporations  to reduce  foreign  exchange,  interest rate and
other price risks (e.g., forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps). We
use a  value-at-risk  ("VAR")  analysis to evaluate  our  exposure to changes in
foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  The  primary  assumptions  used  in the VAR
analysis are as follows:

     o    A Monte Carlo  simulation  model is used to  calculate  changes in the
          value of currency derivative  instruments (e.g., forwards and options)
          and all significant underlying exposures. The VAR analysis includes an
          18-month  exposure  and  derivative  hedging  horizon  and a one-month
          holding period.

                                       58

<PAGE>

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)

     o    The  VAR  analysis   calculates  the  potential  risk,  within  a  99%
          confidence  level,  on  cross-border  currency  cash  flow  exposures,
          including the effects of foreign  currency  derivatives.  (Translation
          exposures  are not  included  in the VAR  analysis).  The Monte  Carlo
          simulation model uses historical  volatility and correlation estimates
          of the  underlying  assets to produce a large  number of future  price
          scenarios, which have a statistically lognormal distribution.

     o    Estimates of correlations  and  volatilities  are drawn primarily from
          the RiskMetricsTM datasets.

     Hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates.
Based on our overall currency exposure (including  derivative  positions) during
2001, the risk during 2001 to our pre-tax cash flow from currency  movements was
on average $300 million,  with a high of $350 million and a low of $275 million.
At December 31, 2001,  currency  movements  are  projected to affect our pre-tax
cash  flow over the next 18  months  by less  than  $275  million,  within a 99%
confidence  level.  Compared with our  projection at December 31, 2000, the 2001
VAR amount is approximately  $25 million lower,  primarily  because of decreased
currency exchange rate volatility.

Commodity Price Risk
--------------------

     Commodity  price risk is the  possibility  of higher or lower  costs due to
changes in the prices of commodities,  such as non-ferrous (e.g.,  aluminum) and
precious metals (e.g., palladium,  platinum and rhodium),  ferrous alloys (e.g.,
steel), energy (e.g., natural gas) and plastics (e.g., polypropylene),  which we
use in the production of motor vehicles. We use derivative  instruments to hedge
the price risk  associated  with the purchase of those  commodities  that we can
economically  hedge.  The fair value liability of such contracts,  excluding the
underlying  exposures,  as of  December  31, 2001 and 2000 was  approximately  a
negative  $259 million and a positive $56 million,  respectively.  The potential
change in the fair value of commodity forward and option  contracts,  assuming a
10%  change in the  underlying  commodity  price,  would be  approximately  $267
million and $280  million at  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  This
amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in
purchasing the underlying commodities.

     In addition to these price-hedging  activities,  our procurement activities
ensure that we have  adequate  supplies of raw  materials  used in our business.
These  procurement  activities  utilize forward  purchase  contracts,  long-term
supply contracts and stockpiles.  The $1 billion pre-tax  write-down of precious
metals,  discussed  in  Note  16 of  the  Notes  to our  Consolidated  Financial
Statements,  related to these procurement  activities.  In conjunction with this
write-down,  we modified our processes so that any price-hedging inherent in our
procurement  activities  is  executed  by or  coordinated  with our  Treasurer's
Office, which manages our price-hedging activity.

     Our   price-hedging   policy  is  based  on  clearly  defined   guidelines.
Speculative actions are not permitted.  In 2001, we enhanced our risk evaluation
to include a VAR  analysis,  using  historical  volatilities,  to  evaluate  our
exposure to changes in commodity  prices  given our  financial  hedges,  forward
procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge.

     Based on our commodity  exposure and related hedging activity,  at December
31, 2001,  commodity  price  movements  are projected to affect our pre-tax cash
flow over the next twelve months by up to $167 million,  within a 99% confidence
level.  Over the last year the VAR  measurements  averaged $339 million,  with a
high  of  $625  million  and a low  of  $167  million.  These  risk  levels  are
substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions.


Counterparty Risk
-----------------

     Counterparty  risk  relates  to the loss we could  incur if a  counterparty
defaulted on an  investment  or a  derivative  contract.  Exposures  managed are
financial and  primarily  relate to  investments  in  fixed-income  products and
derivative  transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate, currency and
commodity  risk. We,  together with Ford Credit,  establish  exposure limits for
each counterparty to

minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification.  Exposures are monitored
on a regular basis.

     Our  approach  to  managing   counterparty  risk  is  forward-looking   and
proactive,  allowing us to take risk  mitigation  actions.  Exposure  limits are
established for both mark-to-market and future potential exposure,  based on our
overall risk tolerance and ratings-based  historical  default  probabilities.  A
Monte Carlo simulation  technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure
by tenor,  within a 95%  confidence  level  (market  convention).  Estimates  of
correlations and volatilities are drawn from RiskMetricsTM datasets.



FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS

Overview
--------

     Ford  Credit is  exposed  to risks in the  normal  course  of its  business
activities.  In addition to counterparty  risk discussed  above,  Ford Credit is
subject to the  following  additional  types of risks that it seeks to identify,
assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures:

     o    Credit risk - the  possibility  of loss from a  customer's  failure to
          make  payments  according  to contract  terms.
     o    Residual risk - the possibility  that the actual proceeds  received by
          Ford  Credit  upon  the  sale of  returned  lease  vehicles  at  lease
          termination  will be lower  than its  internal  forecast  of  residual
          values.
     o    Market risk - the  possibility  that changes in future market interest
          and  currency  exchange  rates  or  prices  will  make  Ford  Credit's
          positions less valuable.
     o    Liquidity  risk - the  possibility of being unable to meet all current
          and future  obligations  in a timely  manner.
     o    Operating  risk - the  possibility  of errors  relating to transaction
          processing  and  systems,  actions  that  could  result in  compliance
          deficiencies  with regulatory  standards or fraud by Ford Credit's own
          employees or outside persons.

     Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to
Ford  Credit's  overall  global  risk.  Business  decisions  are  evaluated on a
risk-adjusted  basis and products are priced  consistent  with these risks.  See
Ford  Motor  Credit  Company's  Annual  Report on  Form-10 K for the year  ended
December 31, 2001 for more information on this subject.

Credit Risk
-----------

     Ford  Credit  extends   consumer   credit  by  purchasing   retail  vehicle
installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle  dealers.  These contracts are
divided into segments by credit risk tier, term and whether the vehicle financed
or  leased is new or used.  Segment  data are used to ensure  that  pricing  and
servicing  procedures  are  commensurate  with the  risk  associated  with  each
contract.  Ford Credit has behavioral  models to assist in determining  the best
collection  strategies.  In general,  collection procedures are designed to keep
accounts current and to collect on delinquent  accounts.  As a final step, after
reasonable  collection efforts have failed,  vehicles are repossessed;  however,
collection  efforts of any remaining  balance continue until the account is paid
in full or determined to be uncollectible.

     Ford Credit also extends  non-consumer  loans,  which include wholesale and
other loans to dealers as well as automotive  financing for commercial entities.
To monitor credit  performance,  Ford Credit requires  dealers to submit monthly
financial  statements,  performs periodic physical audits of vehicles (with more
frequent audits for higher risk dealers),  and monitors  inventory payoffs daily
to detect  adverse  deviations  from  typical  payoff  patterns,  in which  case
appropriate actions are taken.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)

Residual Risk
-------------

     Ford Credit's  lease  contracts are written with vehicle  lease-end  values
that  approximate  residual values  published in Automotive  Leasing Guide.  For
financial  reporting purposes,  however,  Ford Credit sets the internal value of
expected residual values (net of costs) based on a proprietary econometric model
that uses  historical  experience and forward  looking  information  such as new
product  plans,   marketing  programs  and  quality  metrics.   Any  unfavorable
difference  between the  customer  contract  lease-end  value and Ford  Credit's
internal  forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation.  Ford Credit reviews
the depreciation  rates on leased vehicles  quarterly and adjusts them as needed
to reflect changes in the projected residual values.

     At lease  termination,  Ford Credit maximizes residual proceeds through the
use of models to  determine  which  geographic  market  would  yield the highest
resale value, net of transportation cost.  Sometimes,  lease extensions or early
terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns.

Market Risk
-----------

     The goal of  financial  market  risk  management  is to reduce  the  profit
volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Ford
Credit  uses  various  financial  instruments,  particularly  interest  rate and
currency swaps to manage market risk.  Ford Credit is exclusively an end user of
these instruments,  which are commonly referred to as derivatives; and, does not
engage in any trading,  market-making  or other  speculative  activities  in the
derivative markets.

     Since Ford Credit's principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches
between  the terms of assets  and  liabilities,  changes in  interest  rates and
exchange  rates  would have  generally  offsetting  effects on the value of Ford
Credit's financial assets and derivative  instruments and, therefore,  would not
be expected to have a material  impact on Ford  Credit's  financial  position or
results of operations.  For instance,  assuming an instantaneous increase of one
percentage  point in interest  rates applied to all financial  assets,  debt and
hedging  instruments,  Ford  Credit's  after-tax  earnings  would decline by $66
million over the ensuing twelve-month period.


Liquidity Risk
--------------

     One of Ford Credit's major objectives is to maintain  funding  availability
through any  economic  or business  cycle.  Ford  Credit  focuses on  developing
funding  sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt. Ford Credit
also issues debt that, on average, matures later than assets liquidate,  further
enhancing overall liquidity.

     Global funding activities  include the direct and dealer-placed  commercial
paper,  the  placement of term debt to retail and  institutional  investors  and
public and private sale of receivables.  Ford Credit's ability to raise funds at
a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings.

     Management  closely  monitors the amount of  short-term  funding and mix of
short-term funding to total debt, the overall  composition of total debt and the
availability  of  committed  credit  facilities  in  relation  to the  level  of
outstanding  short-term debt. Stress testing of Ford Credit's liquidity position
is conducted periodically.

     For a  detailed  discussion  of Ford  Credit's  funding  sources  and  debt
ratings,  see  Item  7.  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Operating Risk
--------------

     Ford Credit  operates in many  locations and relies on the abilities of its
employees  and  systems  to  process a large  number of  transactions.  Improper
operation  of systems or improper  employee  actions  could  result in financial
loss,  regulatory action and damage to our reputation.  To address this risk, we
and Ford Credit maintain  internal control  processes that identify  transaction
authorization  requirements,  safeguard  assets from misuse or theft, and ensure
the reliability of financial and other data. We also maintain system controls to
maintain the accuracy of information  about our  operations.  These controls are
designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                   ------------------------------------------

NOTE 1.  Accounting Policies
----------------------------

Principles of Consolidation
---------------------------
Our consolidated financial statements include our majority-owned subsidiaries
and reflect our two business sectors: Automotive and Financial Services.
Affiliates that we do not control, but have a significant influence over
operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method.
Subsidiaries where control is expected to be temporary, principally investments
in certain dealerships, are also accounted for on an equity basis. We prepare
our financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States which require management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those
estimates and assumptions. Certain amounts previously disclosed in our press
release and current report on Form 8-K dated January 17, 2002 have been
reclassified, and certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to
conform with current reporting.

Structure of Operations
-----------------------
Our company's sectors, Automotive and Financial Services, are managed as three
primary operating segments (Note 18). The Automotive sector (and segment)
consists of the design, manufacture, sale, and service of cars and trucks. The
Financial Services sector primarily includes two segments, Ford Credit and
Hertz. Ford Credit is comprised of subsidiaries that provide vehicle-related
financing, leasing, and insurance. Hertz rents and leases cars and trucks and
rents industrial and construction equipment. Segment selection was based upon
internal organizational structure, the way in which these operations are managed
and their performance evaluated by our management and our board of directors,
the availability of separate financial results and materiality considerations.

Transactions Between Automotive and Financial Services Sectors
--------------------------------------------------------------
Ford and Ford Credit formally documented certain long-standing business
practices in an agreement dated October 18, 2001. Intersector transactions occur
in the ordinary course of business. Additional details on some of the main
intersector transactions and the effect on each sector's balance sheet at
December 31 is shown below (in billions):

Periodically,  Ford Credit receives interest  supplements and other support cost
payments  from   Automotive  for  providing   special   vehicle   financing  for
low-interest-rate  marketing programs. Ford Credit records these transactions as
revenue  over the life of the  contract.  Amounts  recorded  as  revenue  by the
Financial  Services  sector,  and  billed to the  Automotive  sector,  were $4.0
billion  in 2001,  $3.4  billion  in 2000,  and $3.2  billion  in 1999.  For the
Automotive  sector,  estimated  costs for these  sales  incentive  programs  are
recorded as sales  reductions as described  below under  "Revenue  Recognition -
Automotive Sector".

Revenue Recognition - Automotive Sector
---------------------------------------
Sales are generally recorded when products are shipped to customers and
ownership is transferred. Sales with a guaranteed repurchase option are
accounted for as operating leases over the expected period prior to repurchase.
The carrying value of these vehicles, included in other current assets, was $2
billion at both December 31, 2001 and 2000. Estimated costs for sales incentive
programs are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related
sales are recorded, or at the date the program is both approved and
communicated.

Revenue Recognition - Financial Services Sector
-----------------------------------------------
Revenue from finance receivables, net of certain deferred loan origination costs
that are included as a reduction of financing revenue, is recognized over the
term of the receivable using the interest method. Revenue from operating leases,
net of certain deferred origination costs, is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease. The accrual of interest on loans is
discontinued at the time the loan is impaired. Subsequent amounts of interest
collected are recognized in income only if full recovery of the remaining
principal is probable. Interest supplements paid by the Automotive sector are
recognized over the term of the receivable or operating lease. The Automotive
sector records interest supplements as sales incentives.

Warranty
-------
Estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the
vehicle is sold to a dealer. Estimates for warranty costs are made based
primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Included in our warranty cost
accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell, extended service
plans (i.e., where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond
the base warranty period), product recalls and customer satisfaction actions
outside the base warranty.

Selected Other Costs
--------------------
Freight costs are accrued at the time of sale and are included in cost of sales.
Advertising and engineering, research and development costs are expensed as
incurred and were as follows (in billions):

Special Purpose Entities
------------------------
Ford Credit sells finance receivables to special purpose entities (or SPEs) in
securitization transactions. These SPEs typically issue securities in the form
of notes and certificates that are structured into several classes with senior
classes having priority of payment over subordinated classes. In these
transactions, Ford Credit retains certain securities and other interests in the
sold receivables referred to as retained interests. The retained interests may
include senior notes, subordinated certificates, restricted cash held for the
benefit of SPEs and interest-only strips. Subordinated certificates represent
lower rated classes of securities issued by SPEs. Restricted cash consists of a
portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay
interest and principal to investors if collections on the sold receivables are
insufficient, with any remaining restricted cash returned to Ford Credit after
investors are fully paid. Interest-only strips, also referred to as excess
spread, represent the right to receive collections on the sold receivables in
excess of amounts needed to pay interest and principal to investors and
servicing fees. The retained interests (other than senior notes) serve as credit
enhancement to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs.

In the period the sale occurs, estimated gains or losses from the sale of
finance receivables are recognized based on the relative fair value of the
portion sold and the portion allocated to retained interests. The retained
interests are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded, net of
tax, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

In Ford Credit's wholesale receivables securitization program, the SPE owns a
pool of wholesale receivables from selected dealer accounts. Ford Credit is
required to sell wholesale receivables generated under the selected dealer
accounts from time to time to the SPE. Ford Credit retains the portion of the
sold wholesale receivables that is in excess of the minimum receivables level
required to support the securities issued by the SPE. A part of this retained
interest is available as credit enhancement to senior noteholders. This retained
interest fluctuates as receivables levels increase or decrease over time and as
additional series of securities are issued by the SPE or are paid off. This
retained interest is recorded at fair value.

The number of off-balance sheet SPEs and the amount of assets (in billions) held
by such SPEs were as follows:

Foreign Currency Translation
----------------------------
Foreign currency exchange transaction and translation gains/(losses) included in
consolidated net income in 2001, 2000, and 1999 amounted to $(283) million,
$(115) million, and $308 million, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles
------------------------------
Goodwill and other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization. Intangible assets acquired prior to June 30, 2001 were amortized
through year-end 2001 using the straight-line method over periods not exceeding
40 years. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 eliminates
the requirement to amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets, which will
be subject to an annual impairment test. The total goodwill included in the
Automotive sector's other assets was $5.3 billion and $5.8 billion at December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total goodwill included in the Financial
Services sector's other assets was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. Other intangibles included in the Automotive
sector's other assets were $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively. We are presently evaluating the amount of the
transitional impairment, which may range up to $2 billion or more, related to
Kwik-Fit and other investments. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset
amortization of about $250 million after taxes was charged to income in 2001.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
-------------------------------
We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment on
a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after-tax estimated
cash flows or at the individual asset level if held for sale.

Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trust
----
Ford Motor Company Capital Trust I (the "Trust") has outstanding $632 million 9%
Trust Originated Preferred Securities (the "Preferred Securities"). The sole
assets of the Trust are $651 million aggregate principal amount of Ford Motor
Company 9% Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 2025 (the "Debentures").
At our option, we may redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, on or after
December 1, 2002. To the extent we redeem the Debentures and upon the maturity
of the Debentures, the Trust is required to redeem the Preferred Securities at
$25 per share plus accrued and unpaid distributions. We guarantee the payment of
all distributions and other payments on the Preferred Securities to the extent
not paid by the Trust, but only if and to the extent we have made a payment of
interest or principal on the Debentures.

European Parliament End of Life Vehicle Directive
-------------------------------------------------
Member states of the European Union are presently proposing laws that are
expected to require us and other original equipment manufacturers to take back,
recycle, and dispose of certain vehicles. We will record an estimate for those
potential liabilities upon enactment of the individual member states'
legislation.

No provision for deferred taxes has been made on $860 million of unremitted
earnings (primarily prior to 1998) which are considered to be indefinitely
invested in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Deferred taxes for these unremitted earnings
are not practicable to estimate.

Non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes were $3.5 billion at
December 31, 2001. A substantial portion of these losses has an indefinite
carryforward period; the remaining losses will begin to expire in 2003. Tax
benefits of operating loss carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis,
including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the
eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances.

NOTE 3.  Discontinued Operation
-------------------------------
On June 28, 2000, we distributed our 100% ownership interest in Visteon
Corporation, our former automotive components subsidiary, by means of a tax-free
spin-off in the form of a dividend on Ford Common and Class B Stock. The total
market value of the distribution was $2.1 billion, which resulted in an
after-tax loss of $2.3 billion. This loss represented the excess of the carrying
value of our net investment over the market value on the distribution date. Our
financial statements reflect Visteon as a "discontinued operation" for all
periods shown.

In connection with the spin-off of Visteon, about 24,000 hourly employees
working for Visteon who were represented by the UAW remained Ford employees,
with Visteon agreeing to reimburse Ford for the costs of those employees. The
average number of these employees in 2001 was approximately 20,500. Ford retains

NOTE 3.  Discontinued Operation (Continued)
-------------------------------

certain pension and postretirement benefit obligations for qualified salaried
employees that are working or who have worked for Visteon.

Visteon's revenues, not included in Ford's revenues for periods prior to
spin-off, totaled $10.5 billion and $19.4 billion for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999. Income from discontinued operations for the years
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 is reported net of income tax expense of
$182 million and $422 million.

NOTE 4.  Marketable and Other Securities
----------------------------------------
Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
included in income. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value
with net unrealized holding gains and losses reported, net of tax, in other
comprehensive income. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized
cost. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific
identification method.

The fair value of substantially all securities is determined by quoted market
prices. The estimated fair value of securities for which there are no quoted
market prices is based on similar types of securities that are traded in the
market. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are
recorded at cost. Book value approximates fair value for all securities.

Expected maturities of debt securities may differ from contractual maturities
because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or
without penalty.

Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. About one-third of
inventories were determined under the last-in, first-out method. Reduction of
FIFO inventory in 2001 resulted in a decrement of a base year LIFO layer,
reducing cost of sales by $63 million.

</TABLE>

Most of the retained interest in sold wholesale receivables (about $6.5 billion)
represents the company's undivided interest in wholesale receivables that are
available to support the issuance of additional securities by the SPE
(securitization trust). The balance represents credit enhancement to the holders
of the more senior securities issued by the SPEs. Interest-only strips represent
the present value of monthly collections on the sold finance receivables in
excess of amounts needed by the SPE (securitization trust) to pay interest and
principal to investors and servicing fees that will be realized by Ford Credit.
Subordinated securities, restricted cash and interest-only strips are credit
enhancement assets. Investments in subordinated securities and restricted cash
are senior to interest-only strips for credit enhancement purposes.

The fair value of receivables subject to fair value disclosure requirements, was
estimated by discounting future cash flows using a rate that reflected the
credit, interest, and prepayment risks associated with similar types of
instruments. The amount of net finance receivables subject to fair value at
December 31, 2001 and 2000 was (in millions) $103,878 and $117,664,
respectively. The fair value of these finance receivables at December 31, 2001
and 2000 was (in millions) $104,032 and $118,988, respectively.

Maturities, exclusive of SFAS 133, of total finance receivables were as follows
(in millions): 2002 - $61,150; 2003 - $23,436; 2004 - $10,610;
thereafter - $10,598. Experience indicates that a substantial portion of the
portfolio generally is repaid before the contractual maturity dates.

Minimum rentals on operating leases are contractually due as follows (in
millions): 2002 - $8,701; 2003 - $6,115; 2004 - $3,317; 2005 - $1,362; 2006 -
$123; thereafter - $506.

Vehicles subject to operating leases are depreciated primarily on the
straight-line method over the term of the lease to reduce the asset to its
estimated residual value, based on assumptions for used car prices at lease
termination and the number of vehicles that are expected to be returned.
Depreciation expense (which includes gains and losses on disposal of assets) was
$10.4 billion in 2001, $9.2 billion in 2000, and $8.8 billion in 1999.

NOTE 9.  Allowance for Credit Losses
------------------------------------
The allowance for probable credit losses includes a provision for certain
non-homogeneous impaired loans. Impaired loans are measured based on the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest
rate. Finance receivables and lease investments are charged to the allowance for
credit losses after consideration of the financial condition of the borrower,
the value of the collateral, recourse to guarantors and other factors.
Recoveries are credited to the allowance for credit losses.

Changes in the allowance for credit losses were as follows (in millions):

in 2000, and $860 million in 1999.

Support Facilities
------------------
At December 31, 2001, the Automotive sector had $8.6 billion of contractually
committed credit agreements with various banks; 87.4% are available through June
30, 2006. Ford also has the ability to transfer, on a non-guaranteed basis, $8.0
billion of these credit lines to Ford Credit and FCE Bank plc.

At December 31, 2001, various subsidiaries of the Financial Services sector had
an additional $16.9 billion of contractually committed support facilities; 49.3%
of which are available through June 30, 2006 and $1.0 billion were in use. In
addition, banks provide $12.5 billion of facilities to support Ford Credit's
asset-backed commercial paper program.

Ford Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank-sponsored,
commercial paper issuers under which such issues are contractually committed to
purchase from Ford Credit, at Ford Credit's option, up to an aggregate of $12.4
billion of receivables. These agreements expire between June 27, 2002 and
December 12, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $5.6 billion of these
commitments have been utilized.

NOTE 12.  Capital Stock
-----------------------
All general voting power is vested in the holders of Common Stock and the
holders of Class B Stock. Holders of Common Stock have 60% of the general voting
power and holders of Class B Stock are entitled to such number of votes per
share as would give them, in the aggregate, the remaining 40%. Shares of Common
Stock and Class B Stock share equally in dividends, with stock dividends payable
in shares of stock of the

class held.  If the company is liquidated, each share of Common Stock will be
entitled to the first $0.50 available for distribution to holders of Common
Stock and Class B Stock, each share of Class B Stock will be entitled to the
next $1.00 so available, each share of Common Stock will be entitled to the
next $0.50 so available and each share of Common and Class B Stock will be
entitled to an equal amount thereafter.

In August 2000, under a recapitalization known as the Value Enhancement Plan,
shareholders elected to receive $5.7 billion in cash, and the total number of
Common and Class B shares that became issued and outstanding was 1.893 billion.
Prior period outstanding share and earnings per share amounts were not adjusted.

Series B Depositary Shares, representing 1/2000 of a share of $1.00 par value
Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock, have a liquidation preference of $25 per
Depositary Share. Depositary Shares outstanding at December 31, 2001 were
7,096,688. Dividends are payable at a rate of $2.0625 per year per Depositary
Share. On and after December 1, 2002, and upon satisfaction of certain
conditions, the stock is redeemable for cash at Ford's option, in whole or in
part, at a redemption price equivalent to $25 per Depositary Share, plus an
amount equal to the sum of all accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series B
Cumulative Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Common Stock and Class B Stock in
respect of dividends and liquidation rights.

NOTE 13.  Stock Options
-----------------------

We have stock options outstanding under the 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
and the 1998 LTIP. No further grants may be made under the 1990 LTIP and all
outstanding options are exerciseable. Grants may be made under the 1998 LTIP
through April 2008. All outstanding options under the 1990 LTIP continue to be
governed by the terms and conditions of the existing option agreements for those
grants. Under the 1998 LTIP, 33% of the options are generally exercisable after
the first anniversary of the date of grant, 66% after the second anniversary,
and 100% after the third anniversary. Stock options expire 10 years from the
grant date. Performance stock rights (PSRs) and restricted stock units (RSUs)
are based on performance achievement. At December 31, 2001, 6.5 million PSRs and
2.8 million RSUs were outstanding. Stock options, SARs, PSRs, and RSUs are
described in Ford's Proxy Statement.

Under the 1998 LTIP, 2% of our issued common stock as of December 31 becomes
available for granting plan awards in the succeeding calendar year. Any unused
portion is available for later years. The limit may be increased up to 3% in any
year, with a corresponding reduction in shares available for grants in future
years. At December 31, 2001, the number of unused shares carried forward
aggregated to 42.3 million shares.

We measure compensation cost using the intrinsic value method. Since the option
exercise price is set at fair value at the date of grant, no compensation cost
for stock options has been recognized. If compensation cost had been determined
based on the estimated fair value of options granted since 1995, our pro forma
net income and earnings per share would have been as follows:

NOTE 14.  Derivative Financial Instruments
------------------------------------------
We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, on January 1,
2001. Our operations are exposed to global market risks, including the effect of
changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. We use
derivatives to manage these financial exposures as an integral part of our
overall risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative
purposes. We recognize fair value hedges through earnings and cash flow hedges
through other comprehensive income. In prior years, gains and losses on currency
and interest rate derivatives were deferred and recognized through earnings with
the related underlying transactions.

Exchange rate risk is managed by use of foreign currency agreements, including
forward contracts, swaps, and options. Commodity price risk is managed by use of
forward price contracts and options. Exchange rate and commodity risk
derivatives are primarily accounted for as cash flow hedges and generally mature
in 3 years or less, with a maximum maturity of 8 years. Interest rate risk is
managed by entering into interest rate swap agreements to change the interest
rate characteristics of our debt (primarily used in the Financial Services
sector) to match the interest rate characteristics of related assets. These
interest rate derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value
hedges. In addition, we use forward contracts to hedge certain net investments
in foreign operations and hold other derivatives that presently do not qualify
for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133. During the fourth quarter of
2001, we reevaluated our plans with respect to certain forward purchase
commitments for various precious metals commodities that were previously
excluded from the scope of SFAS No. 133 and determined that they no longer
qualify for exclusion. Accordingly, we recorded a mark-to-market adjustment of
$449 million in our Automotive sector as of December 31, 2001 (Note 16).
Derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges comprise most of the balance of
SFAS No. 133 activity reported as a part of stockholders' equity.

</TABLE>

The $1,099 million recorded in stockholders' equity is comprised of amounts
remaining from the $550 million transition adjustment on January 1, 2001 and net
losses on derivative instruments for the year (net of $144 million of such
amounts reclassified to income/(loss) during the year). We expect to reclassify
losses of $663 million ($96 million relates to transition adjustment) from
stockholders' equity to net income during the next twelve months. These amounts
are net of tax impact. Consistent with our comprehensive, non-speculative
risk-management practices, neither these nor future reclassifications are
anticipated to have a material effect on our net earnings, as they should be
substantially offset by the opposite effects on related underlying transactions.

         Memo:  After-tax effect of charges                               $4.1

In response to significantly deteriorating business conditions resulting in
operating losses, we conducted extensive business reviews of our Automotive
operations in North America and South America during the fourth quarter. As part
of these reviews, we determined that projected undiscounted cash flows were not
sufficient to justify the carrying values of the related long-lived assets.
Asset impairment charges of $3,084 million in North America and $744 million in
South America were recorded in Automotive cost of sales, reflecting a write-down
to estimated fair value, as determined by independent valuations. The impairment
increased depreciation, special tool amortization, and goodwill amortization by
$2,688 million, $867 million, and $273 million, respectively.

Precious metals (primarily palladium) are used in catalytic converters, required
to meet automotive emission standards. Our business objective has been to ensure
adequate supply of these critical commodities. In 2000 and early 2001, we
acquired precious metals and entered into forward purchase contracts at
then-prevailing market prices in an environment of uncertain supply and outlook
(characterized by periodic supply interruptions by a major producer, Russia, and
substantial increases in commodity prices - e.g., palladium prices rose from
about $200 an ounce in 1997 to about $1,100 an ounce in January 2001). In the
fourth quarter of 2001, our engineers validated a breakthrough catalyst design,
which will help reduce our usage of palladium (2002 usage is projected to be
down more than 50% from our usage in 2000). For our precious metals physically
held, we have accordingly revised our stocking requirements and are in the
process of reducing metals that are in excess of those stocking requirements
(including market sales to the extent the market can absorb the metal in an
orderly fashion). We have written down the value of the excess metal to its
estimated realizable value (equal to year-end market price). For precious metal
forward purchase contracts (all of which were previously planned for normal use
in production), we now are planning a number of actions, including cash settling
contracts in lieu of taking physical delivery of the related metal. Therefore,
as required by SFAS No. 133, precious metal forward purchase contracts have been
marked-to-market as of December 31, 2001. The total pre-tax charge for precious
metals was $953 million.

Personnel charges of $565 million before taxes primarily reflected voluntary
salaried employee separations in North America.

Other pre-tax charges mainly reflected a $201 million non-cash charge to equity
in net income of affiliated companies, representing our share of a charge
related to Mazda's pension expenses, and a $160 million charge related to a
major devaluation of the Argentine peso.

Purchase of Remainder of Hertz Corporation - In March, we acquired (for $735
------------------------------------------
million) the common stock of Hertz that we did not own, which represented about
18% of the economic interest in Hertz. The excess of the purchase price over the
fair market value of net assets acquired was approximately $390 million and was
amortized over 40 years in 2001.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actions (Continued)
-------

2000
----
Purchase of Land Rover Business - In June, we purchased the Land Rover sport
-------------------------------
utility vehicle business from the BMW Group for 3 billion euros (equivalent to
$2.6 billion). We paid two-thirds of the purchase price at closing and will pay
the remainder in 2005. The excess of the purchase price over the fair market
value of net assets acquired was approximately $775 million and was amortized
over 40 years in 2000 and 2001.

European Charges - Following an extensive review of the Ford brand Automotive
----------------
operations in Europe, we recorded a pre-tax charge in Automotive cost of sales
of $1.6 billion in the second quarter. This charge included $1.1 billion for
asset impairments and $468 million for restructuring costs. Employee separation
included a workforce reduction of about 3,300 employees (2,900 hourly and 400
salaried) related to the planned cessation of vehicle production at the Dagenham
(U.K.) Body and Assembly Plant. As of December 31, 2001, we have utilized $197
million of the $468 million restructuring charge relating to a workforce
reduction of 2,365 employees and $20 million of other exit related costs.

The asset impairment charge, attributable to excess capacity related to Ford's
performance in the European market, reflected the write-down of certain
long-lived assets, as determined by an independent valuation.

Nemak Joint Venture - During the fourth quarter, we recorded in Automotive cost
-------------------
of sales a pre-tax charge of $205 million related to the fair value transfer of
our Windsor Aluminum Plant, Essex Aluminum Plant, and Casting Process
Development Center for an increased equity interest in our joint venture with
Nemak. We reflected the new joint venture in our consolidated financial
statements on an equity basis.

1999
----
Purchase of AB Volvo's Worldwide Passenger Car Business ("Volvo Car") -
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In March, we purchased Volvo Car for $6.45 billion. The acquisition price
included a cash payment of $2 billion on March 31, 1999, a deferred payment
obligation to AB Volvo of $1.6 billion paid April 2, 2001, and Volvo Car
automotive net indebtedness of $2.9 billion. Most automotive indebtedness was
repaid April 12, 1999. The excess of the purchase price over the fair market
value of net assets acquired was approximately $2.5 billion and was amortized
over 40 years during 1999, 2000, and 2001.

Purchase of Kwik-Fit Holdings plc - During the third quarter, we completed the
---------------------------------
purchase of all the outstanding stock of Kwik-Fit plc ("Kwik-Fit"). Kwik-Fit was
Europe's largest independent vehicle maintenance and light repair chain. The
purchase price was $1.6 billion and consisted of cash payments of $1.4 billion
and loan notes to certain Kwik-Fit shareholders of $200 million, redeemable
beginning April 30, 2000 and on any subsequent interest payment date. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired was
approximately $1.1 billion and was amortized over 30 years during 1999, 2000,
and 2001.

Dissolution of AutoEuropa Joint Venture - On January 1, 1999, we dissolved our
---------------------------------------
minivan joint venture with Volkswagen AG in Portugal (AutoEuropa) resulting in a
$255 million pre-tax gain credited to Automotive cost of sales.

NOTE 17.  Retirement Benefits
-----------------------------

Employee Retirement Plans
-------------------------
We have two principal defined benefit retirement plans in the U.S. The Ford-UAW
Retirement Plan covers hourly employees represented by the UAW, and the General
Retirement Plan covers substantially all other Ford employees in the U.S. The
hourly plan provides noncontributory benefits related to employee service. The
salaried plan provides similar noncontributory benefits and contributory
benefits related to pay and service. Other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries have
separate plans that generally provide similar types of benefits for their
employees. Ford-UAW Retirement Plan expense accruals for employees assigned to
Visteon are charged to Visteon.

In general, our plans are funded, with the main exceptions of the U.S. defined
benefit plans for executives and certain plans in Germany; in such cases, an
unfunded liability is recorded.

Our policy for funded plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts
required by applicable laws, regulations, and union agreements. Plan assets
consist principally of investments in stocks and government and other fixed
income securities. At December 31, 2001, stocks represented 73% of the market
value of pension assets for our principal U.S. plans and fixed income securities
represented 27%. Ford securities comprised less than one-half of one percent of
the value of our worldwide pension plan assets during 2000 and 2001.

We also sponsor defined contribution plans for certain of our U.S. and non-U.S.
employees.  Our expense, primarily for matching contributions, for these plans
was (in millions): $153 in 2001, $145 in 2000, and $140 in 1999.  Effective
January 1, 2002, we suspended matching contributions to these plans.

Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits
------------------------------------------------------
We and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor plans to provide selected health care
and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Our U.S. and Canadian
employees generally may become eligible for those benefits if they retire;
however, benefits and eligibility rules may be modified from time to time.
Postretirement health care and life insurance expense accruals for hourly
employees assigned to Visteon and for salaried Visteon employees who met certain
age and service conditions at June 30, 2000 are charged to Visteon. A portion of
U.S. hourly and salary retiree health and life insurance benefits has been
prepaid. At December 31, 2001, the market value of this pre-funding was $2.7
billion, including $1.7 billion of Visteon promissory notes contributed to a
segregated trust.

Our expense for pension, postretirement health care and life insurance benefits
was as follows (in millions):

* Payment of retiree health care benefits.
</TABLE>

The assumption for expected return on assets reflects our expectation of the
long-term average rate of earnings on pension funds invested to provide for the
benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In making this
assumption, we review the outlook for inflation, fixed income returns and equity
returns, taking into consideration our plans' historical returns, our asset
allocation and investment strategy, as well as the views of investment managers
and other large pension plan sponsors. Although not a guarantee of future
results, the average annual return of our U.S. pension fund has exceeded 9.5%
for the last 10, 20 and 30-year periods. As a sensitivity measure, a one-half
point decrease/increase in our U.S. assumed return would increase/decrease
future annual U.S. pension pre-tax expense by about $190 million and would have
no effect on pension funded status or contribution requirements.

A one percentage point increase/(decrease) in the assumed health care cost trend
rate would increase/(decrease) the postretirement health care benefit obligation
by approximately $3.1 billion/($2.6 billion) and the service and interest
component of this expense by $310 million/($241) million.

NOTE 20.  Litigation and Claims
-------------------------------
Various legal actions, governmental investigations and proceedings and claims
are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us, including
those arising out of alleged defects in our products; governmental regulations
relating to safety, emissions and fuel economy; financial services;
employment-related matters; dealer, supplier and other contractual
relationships; intellectual property rights; product warranties; environmental
matters; and shareholder matters. Certain of the pending legal actions are, or
purport to be, class actions. Some of the foregoing matters involve or may
involve compensatory, punitive, or antitrust or other treble damage claims in
very large amounts, or demands for recall campaigns, environmental remediation
programs, sanctions, or other relief which, if granted, would require very large
expenditures.

Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual
litigated matters is not predictable with assurance. We have established
reserves for certain of the matters discussed in the foregoing paragraph where
losses are deemed probable. It is reasonably possible, however, that some of the
matters discussed in the foregoing paragraph for which reserves have not been
established could be decided unfavorably to us and could require us to pay
damages or make other expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts that cannot
be estimated at December 31, 2001. We do not reasonably expect, based on our
analysis, that such matters would have a material effect on future consolidated
financial statements for a particular year, although such an outcome is
possible.

                        Report of Independent Accountants



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Ford Motor Company:

In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet and the related
consolidated  statements of income,  stockholders' equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of Ford Motor Company
and  Subsidiaries  at  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  and the  results  of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.  These financial statements are the responsibility
of the  Company's  management;  our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements  in  accordance  with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the
United  States of America,  which  require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of
material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements,  on January 1,
2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities".
