The Company estimates that more than 95% of its\nbacklog as of December 31, 2000 will be billed during 2001. Certain of these\norders are subject to cancellation by the customer with payment of a negotiated\ncharge. Because of the possible changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of\norders and potential delays in product shipments, the Company's backlog as of\nany particular date may not necessarily be representative of actual sales for\nany succeeding period.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\n     Because of the wide range of its products and services, the Company faces\nmany different types of competition and competitors. This affects its ability to\nsell its products and services and the prices at which such products and\nservices are sold. Competitors range from large foreign and domestic\norganizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and services, and\nwhich may have greater financial and other resources than the Company, to small\nconcerns producing a small number of goods or services for specialized market\nsegments.\n\n     In the Life Sciences segment, competition is on the basis of product\navailability and reliability, and service level. Size of the competition ranges\nfrom multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized\nfirms that in some cases have well established market niches. The Company\ncompetes in these markets on the basis of innovative technologies, product\ndifferentiation and quality. The proportion of large competitors in this segment\nis expected to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.\n\n                                        5\n<PAGE>   7\n\n     In the Optoelectronics segment, no single competitor competes directly with\nthis segment across its full product range. However, the Company does compete\nwith specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacture and sale of\nspecialty flashtubes and ultraspecialty lighting sources, certain photodetectors\nand photodiodes, switched power supplies and telecommunications products.\nCompetition is based on price, technological innovation, operational efficiency\nand product reliability and quality.\n\n     In the Instruments segment, the Company faces a similar situation in that\nno single competitor competes directly with this segment as a whole. The Company\ncompetes with instrument companies that serve particular segments of markets in\nindustrial instrumentation, and imagining detection systems. The Company\ncompetes in this segment primarily on the basis of product performance, product\nreliability, service and price.\n\n     In the Fluid Sciences segment, competition is typically based on product\ninnovation, quality, service and price. In a few markets, competitors are large,\ndiversified engineering, and manufacturing concerns. Most of the Company's\ncompetitors, however, are small specialized manufacturing companies offering\nfewer product lines for narrower market segments. Competition for lubricant\ntesting services is from a few specialized testing companies and some\ncustomer-owned laboratories, and is mainly based on quality and price.\n\n     The Company competes primarily on the basis of product performance,\ntechnological innovation, service and price.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n     During 2000, 1999 and 1998, Company-sponsored research and development\nexpenditures were approximately $86 million, $71 million and $46 million,\nrespectively.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE\n\n     The Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and\nremedial actions at current and former Company locations and, along with other\ncompanies, has been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain\nwaste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the\naccounting period in which the Company's responsibility is established and when\nthe cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $8.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2000, representing management's estimate of the total cost of\nultimate disposition of known environmental matters. Such amount is not\ndiscounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or\nindemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of\nvariables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the\nmagnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies,\npossible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which remediation may\noccur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where\nthe Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any\nadditional liability to result from the inability of other significant named\nparties to contribute. The Company expects that such accrued amounts could be\npaid out over a period of up to five years. As assessments and remediation\nactivities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and\nadjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have\nbeen no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a\nmaterial effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nWhile it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts\nrecorded may have been incurred, the preliminary stages of the investigations\nmake it impossible for the Company to reasonably estimate the range of potential\nexposure.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\n     As of March 1, 2001, the Company employed approximately 12,500 persons.\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor\nunions. The Company considers its relations with employees to be satisfactory.\n\n                                        6\n<PAGE>   8\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\n     Sales and operating profit by segment for the three years ended December\n31, 2000 are shown in the table below:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n(IN THOUSANDS)                                       2000          1999         1998\n--------------                                    ----------    ----------    --------\n<S>                                               <C>           <C>           <C>\nLIFE SCIENCES\nSales...........................................  $  221,401    $  158,009    $134,635\nOperating Profit (Loss).........................

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n     The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and\ninvestigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary\ncourse of its business activities. Each of these matters is subject to various\nuncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved\nunfavorably to the Company. The Company has established accruals for matters\nthat are probable and reasonably estimable. Management believes that any\nliability that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters in\nexcess of amounts provided will not have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial position or results of operations of the Company.\n\n     The Company has received notices from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nasserting deficiencies in federal corporate income taxes for the Company's 1985\nto 1994 tax years. The total additional tax proposed by the IRS amounts to $74\nmillion plus interest. The Company has filed petitions in the United States Tax\nCourt to challenge most of the deficiencies asserted by the IRS. The Company\nbelieves that it has meritorious legal defenses to those deficiencies and\nbelieves that the ultimate outcome of the case will not result in a material\nimpact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\n\n     The Company and its subsidiary, EG&G Idaho, Inc., were named in 1998 as\ndefendants in a lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Idaho. Filed by two former employees of EG&G Idaho under the Civil\nFalse Claims Act, the suit names as defendants six entities which were formerly,\nor currently are, prime contractors or subcontractors to the Department of\nEnergy at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory.\nPlaintiffs allege that the defendants submitted false claims to the government\nfor reimbursement of environmental activities which they knew or should have\nknown had either not been performed or were performed improperly. After several\npreliminary motions narrowed the scope of the case, discovery is now set to\nbegin. Plaintiffs have yet to quantify the damages they are seeking.\n\n                                        9\n<PAGE>   11\n\n     The Company's subsidiary, EG&G Rocky Flats, Inc. and two other companies\nwere also named as defendants in January 2000 in a civil false claim action\npending in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado\ninvolving security issues at the Department of Energy's Rocky Flats Plant. The\nUnited States Department of Justice has filed a motion seeking to have the case\ndismissed.\n\n     The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters and\nbelieves that their ultimate disposition will not have a material impact on the\nCompany's financial position or results of operations.\n\nITEM 4.

(Vivid) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $67\nmillion. The transaction was a stock merger whereby the shareholders of Vivid\nreceived one share of the Company's common stock for each 6.2 shares of Vivid\ncommon stock; approximately 1.6 million shares were issued in connection with\nthe acquisition. Vivid, which is a leading supplier of automated explosive\ndetection systems utilized in airports and high-security facilities worldwide,\ngenerated sales of $21 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 1999.\nVivid's operations, included in the consolidated results of the Company from the\ndate of acquisition, are reported in the Instruments segment. The acquisition\nwas accounted for as a purchase under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion\nNo. 16, and the Company allocated the purchase price of Vivid based on the fair\nvalues of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Portions of the\npurchase price, including intangible assets, were valued by independent\nappraisers utilizing customary valuation procedures and techniques. These\nintangible assets included approximately $8.1 million for acquired in-process\nresearch and development (R&D) for projects that had not reached technological\nfeasibility as of the acquisition date and for which no alternative use existed.\nThis allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash\nflows related to the in-process R&D projects; these costs were expensed in the\nfirst quarter of 2000. Other acquired intangible assets totaling $6.4 million\nincluded the fair value of developed technology. These intangible assets are\nbeing amortized over their estimated useful life of 10 years. Goodwill of $24.1\nmillion resulting from the acquisition of Vivid is being amortized over 25\nyears.\n\n     On July 31, 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of NEN Life\nSciences, Inc. (NEN), a provider of state-of-the-art drug discovery products,\nservices, reagents and technologies to the life sciences industry.\n\n                                        14\n<PAGE>   16\n\nThe Company purchased NEN from an investor group led by Genstar Capital LLC for\nan aggregate purchase price of approximately $400 million. In connection with\nthe acquisition, the Company paid approximately $350 million in cash and issued\nwarrants to purchase approximately 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock\nin exchange for all of the outstanding shares, options and warrants of NEN. In\naddition, the Company repaid approximately $50 million of outstanding\nindebtedness of NEN. The Company financed the acquisition and repayment of the\noutstanding indebtedness with $410 million of commercial paper borrowings with a\nweighted-average interest rate of 7%. These short-term borrowings were repaid in\nearly August with proceeds from the issuance of long-term convertible\ndebentures.\n\n     NEN's operations, included in the consolidated results of the Company from\nthe date of acquisition, are reported in the Life Sciences segment. The\nacquisition was accounted for as a purchase under APB Opinion No.16, and the\nCompany allocated the purchase price of NEN based on the fair values of the net\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price\nhas not yet been finalized, however, the Company does not expect material\nchanges. Portions of the purchase price, including intangible assets, were\nvalued by independent appraisers utilizing customary valuation procedures and\ntechniques. These intangible assets included approximately $24.3 million for\nacquired in-process R&D for projects that had not reached technological\nfeasibility as of the acquisition date and for which no alternative use existed.\nThis allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash\nflows related to the in-process R&D projects; these costs were expensed in the\nthird quarter of 2000. Other acquired intangible assets totaling $75.9 million\nincluded the fair value of trade names, trademarks, patents and developed\ntechnology. Goodwill of $270.8 million resulting from the acquisition of NEN is\nbeing amortized over 20 years. Approximately $4 million has been recorded as\naccrued restructuring costs in connection with the acquisition of NEN. The\nrestructuring plans include initiatives to integrate the operations of the\nCompany and NEN, and to reduce overhead. The primary components of these plans\nrelate to employment costs, consolidation of certain facilities, and the\ntermination of certain leases and other contractual obligations. Management is\nin the process of developing its restructuring plans related to NEN, and\naccordingly, the amounts recorded are based on management's current estimate of\nthese costs. The Company will finalize these plans during 2001, and the majority\nof the restructuring actions are expected to occur during 2001.\n\n     On May 28, 1999, the Company completed its acquisition of the Analytical\nInstruments Division (AI) of PE Corp. for an aggregate purchase price of\napproximately $425 million, plus acquisition costs. In addition, under the terms\nof the Purchase Agreement dated March 8, 1999 between the Company and PE Corp.\n(the \"Purchase Agreement\"), the Company assumed German and other pension\nliabilities of approximately $65 million. These pension liabilities were\nhistorically funded on a pay-as-you go basis, and the funding going-forward is\nexpected to remain consistent. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase\nunder APB Opinion No. 16 and the Company allocated the purchase price of AI\nbased on the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. AI\nproduces high-quality analytical testing instruments and consumables, and\ngenerated 1998 fiscal year sales of $569 million. AI's operations are reported\nin the Company's Instruments segment. Portions of the purchase price, including\nintangible assets, were valued by independent appraisers utilizing customary\nvaluation procedures and techniques. These intangible assets included\napproximately $23 million for acquired in-process R&D. This allocation\nrepresents the estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related to\nthe in-process R&D projects. At the date of the acquisition of AI, the\ndevelopment of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility, and\nthe R&D in process had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were\nexpensed in the second quarter of 1999. Other acquired intangibles totaling\n$163.8 million included the fair value of trade names, trademarks, patents and\ndeveloped technology. These intangibles are being amortized over their\nrespective estimated useful lives ranging from 10-40 years. Goodwill resulting\nfrom the acquisition of AI is being amortized over 40 years. Approximately $28\nmillion was recorded as accrued restructuring charges in connection with the\nacquisition of AI. The restructuring plans include initiatives to integrate the\noperations of the Company and of AI, and reduce overhead. The primary components\nof these plans relate to: (a) employee termination benefits and related costs\nfor approximately 20% of the acquired workforce of approximately 3,000\nemployees; (b) consolidation or shutdown of certain operational facilities\nworldwide and (c) termination of certain leases and other contractual\nobligations.\n\n                                        15\n<PAGE>   17\n\n     During the second quarter of 2000, the Company finalized its restructuring\nplan for AI. Based on continued aggressive actions by the Company to improve the\ncost structure of the acquired business, and increased costs related primarily\nto employment integration, the Company adjusted its original estimate of\nrestructuring costs in connection with purchase accounting. The majority of the\nremaining restructuring actions are expected to occur through fiscal 2001.\n\n     On December 16, 1998, the Company acquired substantially all of the\noutstanding common stock and options of Lumen Technologies, Inc. (Lumen), a\nmaker of high-technology specialty light sources. The purchase price of\napproximately $253 million, which included $75 million of assumed debt, was\nfunded with existing cash and commercial paper borrowings. The acquisition was\naccounted for as a purchase under APB Opinion No. 16, and the Company allocated\nthe purchase price of Lumen based on the fair values of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed. Portions of the purchase price, including intangible\nassets, were valued by independent appraisers utilizing proven valuation\nprocedures and techniques. These intangible assets included approximately $2.3\nmillion for acquired in-process R&D for projects that did not have future\nalternative uses. This allocation represents the estimated fair value based on\nrisk-adjusted cash flows related to the in-process R&D projects. At the date of\nthe acquisition, the development of these projects had not yet reached\ntechnological feasibility, and the R&D in process had no alternative future\nuses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of 1998.\nAcquired intangibles totaling $11.8 million included the fair value of trade\nnames, trademarks and patents. These intangibles are being amortized over their\nestimated useful life of 10 years. Goodwill resulting from the Lumen acquisition\nis being amortized over 30 years. Approximately $5 million was recorded as\naccrued restructuring charges in connection with the acquisition. The\nrestructuring plans included initiatives to integrate the operations of the\nCompany and Lumen, and to reduce overhead. The primary components of these plans\nrelated to: (a) transfer of certain manufacturing activities to lower-cost\nfacilities, (b) integration of the sales and marketing organization and (c)\ntermination of certain contractual obligations. The restructuring actions have\nbeen completed.\n\n     During the first quarter of 2000, the Company sold its micromachined\nsensors and specialty semiconductor businesses for cash of $24.3 million,\nresulting in a pre-tax gain of $6.7 million. Combined financial results of the\ndivested businesses for 2000 and 1999 were not material to the consolidated\nresults of the Company. During the third quarter of 2000, the Company recorded\npre-tax gains totaling $3.1 million from an insurance settlement and disposition\nof a building.\n\n     During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company sold its Berthold business\nat a pre-tax gain of $10 million. The Company has deferred gain recognition of\napproximately $11.9 million of sales proceeds from this divestiture in\nconnection with certain contingencies related to the sale. Revenues for 2000 and\n1999 for the divested business were $30 million and $38 million, respectively.\nAlso during the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of\n$16 million from the sale of a building.\n\n     During the second quarter of 1999, the Company sold its Structural\nKinematics business for cash of $15 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $4.3\nmillion. Additionally, as a result of the Company's continuing evaluation of its\nInstruments businesses, the Company undertook certain repositioning actions\nduring the second quarter of 1999, including exiting selected product lines and\nactivities, rebalancing its customer mix in certain businesses and other related\nactivities. These actions resulted in second quarter pre-tax charges of\napproximately $3.4 million, primarily recorded in cost of sales. During the\nfourth quarter of 1999, the Company sold its KT Aerofab business for cash of\n$4.4 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $0.3 million. The net operating\nresults of the divested businesses for 1999 were not significant.\n\n     In April 1998, the Company sold its Sealol Industrial Seals division for\ncash of $100 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $58.3 million. The\nafter-tax gain of this divestiture was $42.6 million. Sealol's 1998 sales prior\nto the disposition were $23 million, and its operating income was $2.1 million.\nIn January 1998, the Company sold its Rotron division for $103 million in cash,\nresulting in a pre-tax gain of $64.4 million. During the first quarter of 1998,\nthe Company also sold a small product line for $4 million in cash, resulting in\na pre-tax gain of $3.1 million. The after-tax gain of these divestitures was\n$45.2 million in 1998. During 2000 and 1999, in connection with the 1998\ndispositions of the Company's Rotron and Sealol Industrial Seals divisions, the\n\n                                        16\n<PAGE>   18\n\nCompany recognized approximately $3.7 million and $13.2 million respectively, of\npre-tax gains from the previously deferred sales proceeds as a result of the\nfavorable resolution of certain events and contingencies.\n\n     All of the gains described above are reported on the \"Gains on\nDispositions\" line in the consolidated income statements.\n\nDISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -- 2000 COMPARED TO 1999\n\n     Revenues for 2000 were $1,695 million, increasing $332 million, or 24%,\nversus revenues of $1,363 million in 1999. Organic growth for 2000 was 11%,\nwhich the Company defines as growth in historical businesses plus growth in\nacquired businesses assuming they were owned in prior periods, reduced for the\neffects of exited businesses and foreign exchange. Revenues by segment during\n2000 versus 1999 are discussed in further detail below under the caption\n\"Segment Results of Operations.\"\n\n     Due to the number of changes in the portfolio of businesses, the table\npresented below reconciles reported net income to net income before nonrecurring\nitems and goodwill and intangibles amortization.\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n(IN THOUSANDS)                                                  2000        1999\n--------------                                                --------    --------\n<S>                                                           <C>         <C>\nAdjusted Income from Continuing Operations..................  $236,260    $144,254\nOther Expense, Net..........................................

This increase during 2000 was due to higher\nrevenues discussed above, the benefits of restructuring and productivity\ninitiatives, and the favorable shift of the portfolio to higher margin\nbusinesses through acquisitions and divestitures completed during 2000.\n\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n     The Company's businesses are reported as four segments, reflecting the\nCompany's management methodology and structure. The Company's Technical Services\nsegment has been classified as discontinued operations due to its divestiture\nduring 1999. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those\ndescribed in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements. The Company evaluates performance based on operating profit of the\nrespective segments. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of the\nprimary changes in operating results by segment for 2000 versus 1999 and 1999\nversus 1998.\n\n                                        17\n<PAGE>   19\n\n  Life Sciences\n\n     2000 Compared to 1999\n\n     Sales of $221.4 million for 2000 increased $63.4 million, or 40%, versus\n1999. Organic revenue growth for 2000 was 18%. Higher volumes from high\nthroughput screening, drug discovery applications, revenues from new products,\nand the inclusion of revenues from NEN Life Sciences acquired in August 2000,\nwere the primary drivers of the increase in 2000 versus 1999.\n\n     Purchase accounting and restructuring charges contributed to a reported\noperating loss of $3.6 million for 2000 versus reported operating income of\n$15.8 million in 1999. The 2000 operating loss included goodwill and intangibles\namortization of $9.3 million and certain acquisition related charges and other\nnonrecurring items including a $24.3 million charge for acquired in-process R&D;\na $1.8 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory; $3.9 million of\nnet restructuring charges and $3.5 million of other acquisition-related charges.\nThe 1999 operating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $2.4\nmillion and net restructuring charges of $5.8 million. Operating profit before\ngoodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items for 2000 was $39.2\nmillion, representing an increase of $15.2 million, or 63%, versus 1999. Higher\nrevenues discussed above, particularly sales of higher-margin new products, and\nrevenues from the NEN acquisition contributed to the increase in operating\nprofit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items in\n2000 versus 1999.\n\n     1999 Compared to 1998\n\n     Sales of $158 million for 1999 increased $23.4 million versus 1998.\nAdjusting for the impact of the stronger dollar, revenue growth during 1999 was\n17%. Higher volumes from continued strength in the high throughput screening and\ngenetic disease screening markets, and revenues from new products were the\nprimary contributors to this increase during 1999.\n\n     Reported operating profit was $15.8 million during 1999 versus $9 million\nin 1998, representing an increase of $6.8 million, or 76%. 1999 operating profit\nincluded net restructuring charges of $5.8 million. Excluding nonrecurring items\nin 1999 and 1998, operating profit increased $7.9 million during 1999 to $21.6\nmillion, representing a 58% increase versus 1998. Higher sales discussed above\nand increased gross margins across most businesses, driven primarily by\nhigher-margin new products sold in 1999, were the primary contributors for the\noverall 1999 increase compared to 1998.\n\n  Optoelectronics\n\n     2000 Compared to 1999\n\n     Sales for 2000 were $496.9 million versus $447.7 million in 1999,\nrepresenting an increase of $49.2 million, or 11%. Organic revenue growth for\n2000 was 22%. Strong revenue growth across all businesses contributed to this\nincrease in 2000 versus 1999.\n\n     Reported operating profit increased $56.6 million in 2000 to $96.9 million\nversus $40.3 million in 1999, representing a 140% increase. The 2000 operating\nprofit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $8.1 million and\ncertain nonrecurring items: gains on dispositions of $23.4 million;\nrestructuring credits of $9.9 million; restructuring charges of $10 million and\nrestructuring-related charges of $1.9 million related to the shift by the\nCompany to lower-cost manufacturing areas. The 1999 operating profit included\ngoodwill and intangibles amortization of $9.5 million and certain nonrecurring\nitems: net restructuring charges of $5.5 million and an asset impairment charge\nof $3 million. Operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and\nnonrecurring items for 2000 was $83.6 million, increasing $25.3 million, or 43%,\nversus 1999. The increase in 2000 was due primarily to higher revenues discussed\nabove, the sale of higher-margin new products and the continued benefits of Six\nSigma and other manufacturing initiatives.\n\n                                        18\n<PAGE>   20\n\n     1999 Compared to 1998\n\n     Sales for 1999 were $447.7 million, compared to 1998 sales of $274.5\nmillion, representing an increase of $173.2 million, or 63%. Revenue from the\nacquired specialty lighting business and strong organic growth was partially\noffset by weakness in the sensors business and exited businesses.\n\n     Reported operating profit for 1999 was $40.3 million versus an operating\nloss of $4.1 million in 1998. The 1999 operating income included net\nrestructuring charges of $5.5 million and an asset impairment charge of $3\nmillion. Excluding nonrecurring items, operating profit in 1999 and 1998 was\n$48.8 million and $18.5 million, respectively, representing an increase of $30.3\nmillion, or 164%. The 1999 increase was primarily due to higher revenues\ndiscussed above, higher margin new products, the Company's exit from\nunprofitable businesses and the shift by the Company to lower-cost manufacturing\nareas.\n\n  Instruments\n\n     2000 Compared to 1999\n\n     Sales for 2000 were $725.3 million, increasing $193.1 million, or 36%,\nversus 1999. Organic revenue growth in 2000 was basically flat. The increase in\nreported 2000 revenues versus 1999 was due primarily to the inclusion of the AI\nbusiness for a full year, partially offset by the company's sale of its Berthold\nbusiness in the fourth quarter, the effects of a stronger dollar in 2000 and\nsome softness in the aviation security market.\n\n     Reported operating profit for 2000 was $58.9 million versus an operating\nloss in 1999 of $19.3 million. The 2000 operating profit included goodwill and\nintangibles amortization of $15.5 million and certain acquisition charges and\nrestructuring-related charges and other nonrecurring items: $8.1 million charge\nfor acquired in-process R&D; $1.1 million charge for the revaluation of acquired\ninventory; $11.3 million of gains on dispositions; $2.2 million of\ndivestiture-related charges; $1.4 million of acquisition-related charges and\n$3.5 million of other restructuring-related items. The 1999 operating profit\nincluded goodwill and intangibles amortization of $11 million, certain\nacquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items: $23 million charge for\nacquired in-process R&D; $15 million asset impairment charge; $9.8 million\ncharge for the revaluation of acquired inventory and restructuring-related and\nother charges of $5.8 million.\n\n     For 2000, operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and\nnonrecurring items was $79.4 million versus $45.3 million in 1999, representing\nan increase of $34.1 million, or 75%. The increase is due primarily to the\ninclusion of the Vivid and AI acquisitions for a full year in 2000, improvements\nin manufacturing cost structure and benefits from restructuring actions.\n\n     1999 Compared to 1998\n\n     Sales for 1999 and 1998 were $532.1 million and $185 million, respectively,\nincreasing $347.1 million, or 188%, during 1999 compared to 1998. 1999 revenues\nfrom acquisitions and higher security revenues during 1999 offset the effects of\ndivestitures and lower revenues in certain base businesses, primarily\nautomotive, compared to 1998.\n\n     AI acquisition purchase accounting charges and certain nonrecurring items\nduring 1999 contributed to a reported operating loss of $19.3 million versus\noperating income of $6.6 million in 1998. The 1999 operating loss included the\nfollowing: $23 million charge related to acquired in-process research and\ndevelopment; a $9.8 million charge related to the revaluation of acquired\ninventory; net restructuring charges of $1.4 million; an asset impairment charge\nof $15 million and other repositioning costs of $4.4 million. Excluding\nnonrecurring items in 1999 and 1998, operating profit in 1999 increased $19.8\nmillion, or 136%, to $34.3 million compared to 1998. Operating profit from the\nacquired AI and Lumen photolithography businesses were partially offset by the\neffects of depressed market conditions in the security and automotive businesses\nduring most of 1999.\n\n                                        19\n<PAGE>   21\n\n  Fluid Sciences\n\n     2000 Compared to 1999\n\n     Sales for 2000 increased $26.5 million to $251.8 million, a 12% increase\nversus 1999. Organic revenue growth was 25% in 2000. Strong volume in the\nsemiconductor and power generation markets was the primary contributor to the\nincrease in 2000.\n\n     Reported operating profit for 2000 was $45.1 million, up $14 million, or\n45%, versus 1999. The 2000 operating profit included goodwill and intangibles\namortization of $2.5 million and certain nonrecurring items: gains on\ndisposition of $2.7 million and restructuring charges of $2.4 million. The 1999\noperating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $2.7 million;\n$4.6 million of gains on dispositions and a net restructuring credit of $2.2\nmillion. Operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and\nnonrecurring items for 2000 was $47.7 million, increasing $20.7 million, or 77%\nversus 1999. Higher revenues discussed above and the benefits of lean\nmanufacturing initiatives were the primary contributors to the increase in 2000.\n\n     1999 Compared to 1998\n\n     During the third quarter of 1999, the Company's business segment previously\nreferred to as Engineered Products was renamed Fluid Sciences.\n\n     Sales for 1999 were $225.3 million compared to $237.5 million in 1998,\nrepresenting a $12.2 million, or 5%, decrease. Recovery in the semiconductor\nindustry and continued growth in the power generation businesses was offset by\ncontinued weakness in the aerospace markets and the absence of revenues from\nbusinesses exited by the Company during 1998, primarily certain sheet metal\nfabrication operations.\n\n     Reported 1999 operating profit increased $27.2 million to $31.1 million\ncompared to $3.9 million in 1998. The 1999 operating income included gains on\ndispositions of $4.6 million and a net restructuring credit of $2.2 million.\nExcluding 1999 and 1998 nonrecurring items, 1999 operating profit was $24.3\nmillion versus $25.2 million in 1998. Higher sales discussed above and higher\ngross margins due to Six Sigma and restructuring initiatives were offset by\ncontinued weakness in the aerospace markets and the absence of revenues from\nbusinesses exited by the Company during 1998.\n\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS -- RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\n\n     The Company developed restructuring plans during 1998 to integrate and\nconsolidate its businesses and recorded restructuring charges in the first and\nsecond quarters of 1998, which are discussed separately below.\n\n     During the first quarter of 1998, management developed a plan to\nrestructure certain businesses. The plan resulted in pre-tax restructuring\ncharges totaling $30.5 million. As discussed in Note 3, the principal actions in\nthe restructuring plan included close-down or consolidation of a number of\noffices and facilities, transfer of assembly activities to lower-cost geographic\nlocations, disposal of underutilized assets, withdrawal from certain product\nlines and general cost reductions.\n\n     During the second quarter of 1998, the Company expanded its continuing\neffort to restructure certain businesses to further improve performance. The\nplan resulted in additional pre-tax restructuring charges of $19.5 million. As\ndiscussed in Note 3, the principal actions in this restructuring plan included\nthe integration of operating divisions into five strategic business units\n(SBUs), close-down or consolidation of a number of production facilities and\ngeneral cost reductions. The Technical Services segment was subsequently sold\nduring the third quarter of 1999.\n\n                                        20\n<PAGE>   22\n\n     The following table summarizes the current year restructuring activity\nrelated to the 1998 plans:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n(IN MILLIONS)\n-------------\n<S>                                                           <C>\nAccrued restructuring costs at beginning of period..........  $ 6.4\nReversals...................................................

The charges do not include\nadditional costs associated with the restructuring plans, such as training,\nconsulting, purchase of equipment and relocation of employees and equipment.\nThese costs were charged to operations or capitalized, as appropriate, when\nincurred.\n\n     During the third quarter of 1999, due to the substantial completion of the\nactions of the 1998 restructuring plans, the Company reevaluated its 1998\nrestructuring plans. As a result of this review, costs associated with the\npreviously planned shutdown of two businesses were no longer required due to\nactions taken to improve performance. As a result of these developments, the\nCompany recognized a restructuring credit of $12 million during the third\nquarter of 1999, which primarily affected the Fluid Sciences and Optoelectronics\nsegments. The $12 million credit is reflected in \"Restructuring Charges, Net\" in\nthe consolidated income statements.\n\n     During the second quarter of 2000, the Company recognized a restructuring\ncredit of $6 million related to its 1998 restructuring plans. This resulted from\nthe Company's strategic review during the second quarter of 2000 of its\nportfolio of businesses, actions taken to improve performance at costs lower\nthan originally estimated, and the sale of certain businesses included in the\nrestructuring plans.\n\n     The acquisitions by the Company discussed in Note 2 and the Company's\ndivestiture during the third quarter of 1999 of its Technical Services segment\n(exiting government services) were strategic milestones in the Company's\ntransition to a commercial high technology company. Consistent with the\nstrategic direction of the Company and concurrent with the reevaluation of\nexisting restructuring plans during the third quarter of 1999, the Company\ndeveloped additional plans during the third quarter of 1999 to restructure\ncertain businesses to continue to improve the Company's performance.\n\n     These plans resulted in a pre-tax restructuring charge of $23.5 million\nrecorded in the third quarter of 1999. As discussed in Note 3, the principal\nactions in these restructuring plans include close-down or consolidation of a\nnumber of offices and facilities, transfer of assembly activities to lower-cost\ngeographic locations, disposal of underutilized assets, withdrawal from certain\nproduct lines and general cost reductions. The restructuring plans are expected\nto result in the elimination of approximately 400 positions, primarily in the\nmanufacturing and sales categories. The major components of the restructuring\ncharge were $13.6 million of employee separation costs to restructure the\nworldwide organization, including the sales and manufacturing focus, $2.3\nmillion of noncash charges to dispose of certain product lines and assets\nthrough sale or abandonment and $7.6 million of charges to terminate lease and\nother contractual obligations no longer required as a result of the\nrestructuring plans. The charges do not include additional costs associated with\nthe restructuring plans, such as training, consulting, purchase of equipment and\nrelocation of employees and equipment. These costs will be charged to operations\nor capitalized, as appropriate, when incurred.\n\n                                        21\n<PAGE>   23\n\n     The following table summarizes the current year restructuring activity\nrelated to the 1999 plan:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n(IN MILLIONS)\n-------------\n<S>                                                           <C>\nAccrued restructuring costs at beginning of period........    $ 20.8\nProvisions................................................       2.4\nReversals.................................................

These charges related to\nthe Company's Life Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. The principal actions\nin the restructuring actions included close-down or consolidation of a number of\noffices and facilities, transfer of assembly activities to lower cost geographic\nlocations, disposal of unutilized assets and general cost reductions. The\nrestructuring charges were broken down as follows by operating segment: The Life\nSciences' principal actions are associated with rationalization of its\ndistribution network and overall facility consolidation. The Optoelectronics'\nprincipal actions are associated with its Lighting and Imaging businesses and\nrelate to the shift of certain manufacturing to low cost geographic areas,\nfacility consolidation and general cost reductions.\n\n     The following table summarizes activity related to the 2000 plan:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                                         TERMINATION\n                                                          DISPOSAL        OF LEASES\n                                           EMPLOYEE      OF CERTAIN       AND OTHER\n                                          SEPARATION    PRODUCT LINES    CONTRACTUAL\n(IN MILLIONS)                               COSTS        AND ASSETS      OBLIGATIONS    TOTAL\n-------------                             ----------    -------------    -----------    -----\n<S>                                       <C>           <C>              <C>            <C>\nLife Sciences...........................    $ 2.9           $ .1            $2.1        $ 5.1\nOptoelectronics.........................      7.2            2.8              --         10.0\n                                            -----           ----            ----        -----\nTotal restructuring charges.............     10.1            2.9             2.1         15.1\nAmounts during 2000.....................       --             --              --           --\n                                            -----           ----            ----        -----\nAccrued restructuring costs at December\n  31, 2000..............................    $10.1           $2.9            $2.1        $15.1\n</TABLE>\n\n     During the second quarter of 2000, the Company finalized its original\nestimates of the goodwill and restructuring plans related to the acquired AI\nbusiness. As a result of strategic review of the acquired business, continued\naggressive actions by the Company to improve the cost structure of the acquired\nbusiness, and increased costs related primarily to employment integration, the\nCompany adjusted its original estimate of restructuring costs recorded at the\nacquisition date in connection with purchase accounting.\n\n     Approximately $4 million was recorded as accrued restructuring costs in\nconnection with the NEN acquisition in the third quarter of 2000.\n\n     The following table summarizes the current year restructuring activity\nrelated to the Lumen, AI, and NEN acquisitions:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n(IN MILLIONS)\n-------------\n<S>                                                           <C>\nAccrued restructuring costs at beginning of period..........  $14.1\nProvisions, through purchase accounting, net................   28.0\nCharges/Writeoffs...........................................

Cash outlays during\n2000 were approximately $33 million for all of these plans.\n\n                                        22\n<PAGE>   24\n\nThe Company expects to incur approximately $30 to $35 million of cash outlays in\nconnection with these plans throughout fiscal 2001. These funds will come from\noperating cash flows or borrowings from existing credit facilities. The majority\nof the actions remaining are expected to occur during 2001. The estimated full\nyear's pre-tax savings under the restructuring plans, due primarily to lower\ndepreciation and lower employment costs, when the plans are fully implemented\nare anticipated to be approximately $30 to $35 million, or $.39 to $.45 per\nshare.\n\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\n     On August 20, 1999, the Company sold the assets of its Technical Services\nsegment, including the outstanding capital stock of EG&G Defense Materials,\nInc., a subsidiary of the Company, to EG&G Technical Services, Inc., an\naffiliate of The Carlyle Group LP (the \"Buyer\"), for approximately $250 million\nin cash and the assumption by the Buyer of certain liabilities of the Technical\nServices segment. Details of the transaction are discussed in Note 7 to the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n     The results of operations of the Technical Services segment were previously\nreported as one of five business segments of the Company. The Company accounted\nfor the sale of its Technical Services segment as a discontinued operation in\naccordance with APB Opinion No. 30 and, accordingly, the results of operations\nof the Technical Services segment have been segregated from continuing\noperations and reported as a separate line item on the Company's accompanying\nconsolidated income statements.\n\nOTHER EXPENSE\n\n  2000 Compared to 1999\n\n     Other expense, net, was $42.1 million in 2000 versus $21.8 million in 1999.\nThis net increase in other expense was due primarily to the higher interest\nexpense on increased debt levels resulting from acquisitions.\n\n  1999 Compared to 1998\n\n     Other expense, net, was $21.8 million in 1999 versus $1.4 million in 1998.\nThis net increase in other expense was due primarily to the impact of higher\ninterest expense on increased debt levels, at higher 1999 short-term rates,\nresulting from acquisitions. Included in 1999 other expense was $2.2 million of\nincome received by the Company related to the demutualization of a life\ninsurance company in which the Company is a policyholder.\n\nINCOME TAX PROVISION\n\n     The provision for income taxes on pre-tax income from continuing operations\nfor 2000 and 1999 was $58.4 million and $16.5 million, respectively. Reported\nincome tax expense as a percent of pre-tax income for 2000 and 1999 was 40.4%\nand 36.8%, respectively, due, in part, to the income tax effect on nonrecurring\nitems. Excluding the nonrecurring items and related tax effects, the effective\ntax rate was 32.5% in 2000 and 32% in 1999.\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n     Short-term debt at December 31, 2000 was $186 million and was comprised\nprimarily of commercial paper borrowings. The weighted-average interest rate on\nthe commercial paper borrowings, which had maturities of 60 days or less, was\n6.7%.\n\n     Short-term debt at January 2, 2000 was $382 million and included one-year\npromissory notes of $150 million issued to PE Corp. at an interest rate of 5%,\nmoney market loans of $85 million and commercial paper borrowings of $140\nmillion.\n\n     In March 2001, the Company's $300 million revolving credit facility was\nrefinanced and will expire in March 2002 and the Company also refinanced an\nadditional $100 million revolving credit facility which expires in March 2006.\nThese agreements, which serve as backup facilities for the commercial paper\n\n                                        23\n<PAGE>   25\n\nborrowings, have no significant commitment fees. There were no amounts\noutstanding under these lines at January 2, 2000 or December 31, 2000.\n\n     At December 31, 2000 and January 2, 2000, long-term debt was $583.3 million\nand $114.9 million, respectively, and included $115 million of unsecured\nten-year notes issued in October 1995 at an interest rate of 6.8%, which mature\nin 2005. The carrying amount approximated the estimated fair value at December\n31, 2000, based on a quoted market price.\n\n     In August 2000, the Company sold zero coupon senior convertible debentures\nwith an aggregate purchase price of $460 million. The Company used the\noffering's net proceeds of approximately $448 million to repay a portion of its\ncommercial paper borrowings, which had been increased temporarily to finance the\nNEN acquisition. Deferred issuance costs of $12 million were recorded as a\nnoncurrent asset and are being amortized over three years. The debentures, which\nwere offered by a prospectus supplement pursuant to the Company's effective\nshelf registration statement, are due August 2020, and were priced with a yield\nto maturity of 3.5%. At maturity, the Company will repay $921 million, comprised\nof $460 million of original purchase price plus accrued interest. The Company\nmay redeem some or all of the debentures at any time on or after August 7, 2003\nat a redemption price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue\ndiscount through the redemption date. Holders of the debentures may require the\nCompany to repurchase some or all of the debentures in August 2003 and August\n2010, or at any time when there is a change in control of the Company, as is\ncustomary and ordinary for debentures of this nature, at a repurchase price\nequal to the initial price to the public plus accrued original issue discount\nthrough the date of the repurchase. The debentures are currently convertible\ninto 5.4 million shares of the Company's common stock at approximately $85 per\nshare.\n\n     In connection with the completion of the NEN acquisition on July 31, 2000,\nthe Company paid approximately $350 million in cash and issued warrants to\npurchase approximately 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock in exchange\nfor all of the outstanding shares, options and warrants of NEN. In addition, the\nCompany repaid approximately $50 million of outstanding indebtedness of NEN. The\nCompany financed the acquisition and repayment of the outstanding indebtedness\nwith $410 million of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted-average\ninterest rate of 7%. These short-term borrowings were repaid in August 2000 with\nproceeds from the issuance of long-term convertible debentures, as discussed\nabove.\n\n     Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1.1 million and were $125.6 million\nat the end of fiscal 2000. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2000\nwas $145.5 million. This was comprised of net income before depreciation,\namortization and other noncash items, net, of $212 million, partially offset by\ngains on dispositions and sales of investments, net, of $39.6 million and a\n$26.9 million net change in certain assets and liabilities and other items\nduring 2000. The primary components of this net change included a $4.3 million\nincrease in accounts receivable, a $23.4 million increase in inventory and $33\nmillion of cash outlays associated with restructuring activities. The increase\nin inventory is due primarily to the inclusion of Vivid and NEN, both acquired\nin 2000. Capital expenditures were $70.6 million in 2000. The Company estimates\nthat fiscal 2001 capital expenditures will be approximately $65 to $70 million.\n\n     During 2000 and 1999, the Company purchased 198 thousand and 20 thousand\nshares, respectively, of its common stock through periodic purchases on the open\nmarket at a cost of $10.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. As of December\n31, 2000 the Company had authorization to purchase 5.7 million additional\nshares.\n\n     The Company has relatively limited involvement with derivative financial\ninstruments and uses forward contracts to mitigate the effect of foreign\ncurrency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The\ncontracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one month and have no\ncash requirements until maturity. Credit risk and market risk are minimal\nbecause the contracts are with large banks and gains and losses are offset\nagainst foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying hedged transactions.\nThe notional amount of outstanding forward contracts was approximately $190\nmillion as of December 31, 2000.\n\n                                        24\n<PAGE>   26\n\nDIVIDENDS\n\n     During fiscal 2000, the Company's Board of Directors declared four regular\nquarterly cash dividends of 14 cents per share, each resulting in an annual rate\nof 56 cents per share.\n\nSTOCK SPLIT\n\n     On January 30, 2001, the Company announced its intention to effect a two\nfor one split of its common stock. The proposed split is subject to the approval\nof the Company's shareholders at its Annual Meeting on April 24, 2001.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL\n\n     The Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and\nremedial actions at current and former Company locations and, along with other\ncompanies, has been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain\nwaste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the\naccounting period that the Company's responsibility is established and when the\ncost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $8.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2000, representing management's estimate of the total cost of\nultimate disposition of known environmental matters. Such amount is not\ndiscounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or\nindemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of\nvariables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the\nmagnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies,\npossible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which remediation may\noccur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where\nthe Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any\nadditional liability to result from the inability of other significant named\nparties to contribute. The Company expects that such accrued amounts could be\npaid out over a period of up to five years. As assessments and remediation\nactivities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and\nadjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have\nbeen no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a\nmaterial effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nWhile it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts\nrecorded may have been incurred, the preliminary stages of the investigations\nmake it impossible for the Company to reasonably estimate the range of potential\nexposure.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION AND FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE\n\n     This report contains \"forward-looking statements\" as defined in Section 21E\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission Act of 1934. For this purpose, any\nstatements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact\nmay be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as \"believes,\"\n\"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"will\" and similar expressions are intended\nto identify forward-looking statements. There are a number of important factors\nthat could cause the results of PerkinElmer, Inc. to differ materially from\nthose indicated by these forward-looking statements including, among others, the\nfactors set forth below.\n\n     The following important factors affect our business and operations\ngenerally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations:\n\n     OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE HARMED IF THE INDUSTRIES INTO WHICH WE SELL\n     OUR PRODUCTS ARE IN DOWNWARD CYCLES.\n\n          Some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are\n     cyclical. Industry downturns often are characterized by reduced product\n     demand, excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling\n     prices. Any significant downturn in our customers' markets or in general\n     economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our\n     products and could harm our business. For example, in 1998 the operating\n     results of our Fluid Sciences segment were adversely affected by the\n     downturn in the semiconductor market.\n\n                                        25\n<PAGE>   27\n\n     IF WE DO NOT INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER, OUR PRODUCTS COULD\n     BECOME OBSOLETE, AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS WOULD SUFFER.\n\n          We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid\n     technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and\n     evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new\n     products and enhancements, our products could become technologically\n     obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would\n     suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several\n     factors, including our ability to:\n\n        - accurately anticipate customer needs;\n\n        - innovate and develop new technologies and applications;\n\n        - successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\n\n        - price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our\n          products in sufficient volumes and on time; and\n\n        - differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings.\n\n          Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and\n     manufacture their products. We therefore must anticipate industry trends\n     and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers'\n     products. In developing any new product, we may be required to make a\n     substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of\n     the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers' needs and\n     future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of\n     products that do not lead to significant revenue.\n\n     ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL SALES AND\n     OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES.\n\n          Since we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to\n     risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that\n     revenue from international operations will continue to represent a\n     substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our\n     manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the\n     United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety\n     of factors, including:\n\n        - changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\n        - changes in a country's or region's political or economic conditions,\n          particularly in developing or emerging markets;\n\n        - longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of\n          collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;\n\n        - trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\n        - differing tax laws and changes in those laws;\n\n        - difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\n        - differing labor laws and changes in those laws;\n\n        - differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that\n          protection; and\n\n        - differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.\n\n     FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE\n     TO DECLINE.\n\n          Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot\n     reliably predict future revenue and profitability. Changes in competitive,\n     market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations. A\n     high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant\n     sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small\n     declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our\n\n                                        26\n<PAGE>   28\n\n     operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly\n     operating results and the market price of our common stock include:\n\n        - demand for and market acceptance of our products;\n\n        - competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices;\n\n        - adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which\n          we do business;\n\n        - adverse changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical discovery,\n          telecommunications, semiconductors and electronics, on which we are\n          particularly dependent;\n\n        - changes in the portions of our revenue represented by our various\n          products and customers;\n\n        - delays or problems in the introduction of new products;\n\n        - our competitors' announcement or introduction of new products,\n          services or technological innovations;\n\n        - increased costs of raw materials or supplies; and\n\n        - changes in the volume or timing of product orders.\n\n          In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume\n     fluctuations. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices\n     of securities for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionate to\n     the operating performance of specific companies. These broad market\n     fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\n     WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY,\n     INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES INTO OUR EXISTING BUSINESS OR MAKE ACQUIRED\n     BUSINESSES PROFITABLE.\n\n          One of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by\n     acquiring businesses and technologies that complement or augment our\n     existing product lines. We may be unable to identify or complete promising\n     acquisitions for many reasons, including:\n\n        - competition among buyers;\n\n        - the need for regulatory approvals, including antitrust approvals; and\n\n        - the high valuations of businesses.\n\n          Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally\n     profitable or unprofitable. For these acquired businesses to achieve\n     acceptable levels of profitability, we must improve their management,\n     operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in\n     this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired\n     businesses into our existing operations.\n\n          To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds,\n     either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain\n     such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms.\n\n     WE FACE AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION IN MANY AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS; IF WE DO NOT\n     COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED.\n\n          We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many\n     areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all\n     of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products\n     and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner. We\n     anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to\n     stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and entire\n     product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that\n     reduce the value of these product lines.\n\n                                        27\n<PAGE>   29\n\n     IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOOD AND DRUG\n     ADMINISTRATION'S REGULATIONS AND THOSE OF OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, WE\n     MAY BE FORCED TO RECALL PRODUCTS AND CEASE THEIR MANUFACTURE AND\n     DISTRIBUTION, AND WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES.\n\n          Some of the products produced by our Life Sciences segment are subject\n     to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar\n     international agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product\n     activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing,\n     promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with the FDA's\n     regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to\n     recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition,\n     we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.\n\n     CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR\n     INCREASE OUR EXPENSES.\n\n          We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with\n     federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental,\n     health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and\n     market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations.\n     Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our\n     products.\n\n     OBTAINING AND ENFORCING PATENT PROTECTION FOR OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS,\n     PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE; WE MAY INFRINGE\n     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.\n\n          Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because\n     developing and marketing new technologies and products is time-consuming\n     and expensive. We own many U.S. and foreign patents and intend to apply for\n     additional patents to cover our products. We may not obtain issued patents\n     from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us.\n     The claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to\n     protect our technology.\n\n          Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent issued\n     patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and\n     operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. We\n     may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our\n     proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties. In\n     addition, claims of third parties against us could result in awards of\n     substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from\n     making, using or selling our products in the U.S. or abroad.\n\n     WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL EXISTING DEBT AND MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT IN THE\n     FUTURE.\n\n          We have substantial amounts of outstanding indebtedness. Our\n     substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be\n     unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on and\n     other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due. We may also\n     obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit and\n     issue additional commercial paper to meet future financing needs, which\n     would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.\n\n          Our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences,\n     including:\n\n        - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry\n          conditions;\n\n        - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\n        - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow\n          from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the\n          amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including\n          capital expenditures;\n\n        - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in\n          our business and the industries in which we compete; and\n\n        - placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged\n          competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital\n          resources.\n\n                                        28\n<PAGE>   30\n\n          A significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest\n     at floating rates. As a result, our interest payment obligations on such\n     indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase.\n\nMARKET RISK\n\n     Market Risk:  The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in\ninterest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to\nthese exposures, the Company enters into various derivative transactions\npursuant to the Company's policies to hedge against known or forecasted market\nexposures.\n\n     Foreign Exchange Risk Management:  As a multinational corporation, the\nCompany is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. As the Company's\ninternational sales grow, exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company's financial results. The Company's risk\nfrom exchange rate changes is primarily related to non-dollar denominated sales\nin Europe and Asia. The Company uses foreign currency forward and option\ncontracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses\nthese derivative instruments to reduce its foreign exchange risk by essentially\ncreating offsetting market exposures. The instruments held by the Company are\nnot leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. The Company uses forward\nexchange contracts to hedge its net asset (balance sheet) position. The success\nof the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the\nvarious currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or\nunderstated during periods of currency volatility, the Company could experience\nunanticipated currency gains or losses. The principal currencies hedged are the\nBritish Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen and Singapore Dollar. In\nthose currencies where there is a liquid, cost-effective forward market, the\nCompany maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its\nanticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year. The gains\nand losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related\nexposure.\n\n     Interest Rate Risk:  The Company maintains an investment portfolio\nconsisting of securities of various issuers, types and maturities. The\ninvestments are classified as available for sale. These securities are recorded\non the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded\nin comprehensive income. These instruments are not leveraged, and are not held\nfor trading purposes.\n\n     Value-At-Risk:  The Company utilizes a Value-at-Risk (\"VAR\") model to\ndetermine the maximum potential loss in the fair value of its interest rate and\nforeign exchange sensitive derivative financial instruments within a 95%\nconfidence interval. The Company's computation was based on the\ninterrelationships between movements in interest rates and foreign currencies.\nThese interrelationships were determined by observing historical interest rate\nand foreign currency market changes over corresponding periods. The assets and\nliabilities, firm commitments and anticipated transactions, which are hedged by\nderivative financial instruments, were excluded from the model. The Company's\ncomputations are based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence\ninterval and a holding period of 30 days. The VAR model is a risk analysis tool\nand does not purport to represent actual gains or losses in fair value that will\nbe incurred by the Company. The VAR model estimated that there is a 5% chance\nthat the market value of the derivative instruments held as of December 31, 2000\nwill deteriorate due to foreign exchange fluctuations by more than $3 million.\nDuring the four quarters ended December 31, 2000, the VAR ranged between $1\nmillion and $3 million, and averaged approximately $1.8 million.\n\n     Management periodically reviews its interest rate and foreign currency\nexposures and evaluates strategies to manage such exposures in the near future.\nThe Company implements changes, when deemed necessary, in the management of\nhedging instruments which mitigate its exposure.\n\n     Since the Company utilizes interest rate and foreign currency sensitive\nderivative instruments for hedging, a loss in fair value for those instruments\nis generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying transaction.\n\n     It is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate\ntransactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as\nstated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate\ntransactions for speculative purposes.\n\n                                        29\n<PAGE>   31\n\nITEM 8.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 1.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n     Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. (formerly EG&G, Inc.) and its subsidiaries\n(the Company). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\n\n     Nature of Operations:  PerkinElmer, Inc. is a global high technology\ncompany which provides products and systems to the telecom, medical,\npharmaceutical, chemical, semiconductor, photographic and other markets. The\nCompany's operating segments are Life Sciences, Optoelectronics, Instruments and\nFluid Sciences. In August 1999, the Company divested its Technical Services\nsegment, which is presented as discontinued operations in accordance with\nAccounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of\nOperations (see Note 7).\n\n     Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity\nwith generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n     Sales:  The majority of the Company's product sales are recorded at the\ntime of shipment and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the\nseller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is\nreasonably assured. Provision is made at the time the related revenue is\nrecognized for the cost of any installation obligations and the estimated cost\nof product warranties. When other significant obligations remain after products\nare delivered, including certain customer acceptance provisions, revenue is\nrecognized only after such obligations are fulfilled. If a loss is anticipated\non any contract, provision for the entire loss is made immediately. Revenue\nrelated to the sale of maintenance contracts is deferred and amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over the service period. For equipment leased to a customer\nunder a sales-type lease, revenue recognition generally commences when the\nequipment has been shipped and installed.\n\n     In the fourth quarter of 2000, retroactive to January 1, 2000, the Company\nadopted Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin\n(\"SAB\") No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, which provides\nguidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to certain revenue\nrecognition issues. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a material impact on\nthe Company's financial position or quarterly or annual results of operations.\n\n     The former Technical Services segment had cost-reimbursement contracts with\ngovernmental agencies. These contracts included both cost plus fixed fee\ncontracts and cost plus award fee contracts based on performance. Sales under\ncost-reimbursement contracts were recorded as costs were incurred and included\napplicable income in the proportion that costs incurred bear to total estimated\ncosts.\n\n     Inventories:  Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing\noverhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market. The majority of inventories\nis accounted for using the first-in, first-out method of determining inventory\ncosts; remaining inventories are accounted for using the last-in, first-out\n(LIFO) method.\n\n     Property, Plant and Equipment:  For financial statement purposes, the\nCompany depreciates plant and equipment using the straight-line method over\ntheir estimated useful lives, which generally fall within the following ranges:\nbuildings and special-purpose structures -- 10 to 25 years; leasehold\nimprovements -- estimated useful life or remaining term of lease, whichever is\nshorter; machinery and equipment -- 3 to 7 years. Nonrecurring tooling costs are\ncapitalized, while recurring costs are expensed. For income tax purposes, the\nCompany depreciates plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using\naccelerated methods.\n\n     Pension Plans:  The Company's funding policy provides that payments to the\nU.S. pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements\nof the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Non-U.S. plans are\naccrued for, but generally not funded, and benefits are paid from operating\nfunds.\n\n                                        34\n<PAGE>   36\n                       PERKINELMER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)\n\n     Translation of Foreign Currencies:  The balance sheet accounts of non-U.S.\noperations, exclusive of stockholders' equity, are translated at year-end\nexchange rates, and income statement accounts are translated at weighted-average\nrate in effect during the year; any translation adjustments are made directly to\na component of stockholders' equity.\n\n     Intangible Assets:  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting\nStandards (SFAS) No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and\nfor Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible\nAssets, the Company reviews long-lived assets and all intangible assets\n(including goodwill) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted\nundiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate, to the\ncarrying amount including associated intangible assets of such operation. If the\noperation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its\nassets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other\nlong-lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is determined\nbased on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of\nthe assets. (See Note 4 for further discussion of asset impairment charges.)\n\n     Stock-Based Compensation:  In accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for\nStock-Based Compensation, the Company accounts for stock-based compensation at\nintrinsic value with disclosure of the effects of fair value accounting on net\nincome and earnings per share on a pro forma basis.\n\n     Cash Flows:  For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the\nCompany considers all highly liquid instruments with a purchased maturity of\nthree months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and\ncash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities.\n\n     Environmental Matters:  The Company accrues for costs associated with the\nremediation of environmental pollution when it is probable that a liability has\nbeen incurred and the Company's proportionate share of the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities have not been discounted.\n\n     Comprehensive Income:  The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No.\n130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which established standards for reporting\nand display of comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive income is\nthe total of net income and all other nonowner changes in stockholders' equity.\n\n     Segments and Related Information:  The Company has adopted the provisions\nof SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related\nInformation. The statement established standards for the way that public\nbusiness enterprises report information and operating segments in annual\nfinancial statements and requires reporting of selected information in interim\nfinancial reports.\n\n     Derivative Instruments and Hedging:  The Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging\nActivities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133, in June 1999. SFAS\nNo. 133 is now effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning\nafter June 15, 2000; earlier adoption is allowed. The statement requires\ncompanies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities,\nmeasured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of\nthose derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative\nand whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The effect of the adoption of\nSFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001 will not be material.\n\n     Reclassifications:  Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified\nto conform to the 2000 financial statement presentation.\n\nNOTE 2.  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\n     On January 14, 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of Vivid\nTechnologies, Inc. (Vivid) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $67\nmillion. The transaction was a stock merger whereby the shareholders of Vivid\nreceived one share of the Company's common stock for each 6.2 shares of Vivid\ncommon stock; approximately 1.6 million shares were issued in connection with\nthe acquisition. Vivid, which is a leading\n                                        35\n<PAGE>   37\n                       PERKINELMER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)\n\nsupplier of automated explosive detection systems utilized in airports and\nhigh-security facilities worldwide, generated sales of $21 million for the\ntwelve months ended September 30,1999. Vivid's operations, included in the\nconsolidated results of the Company from the date of acquisition, are reported\nin the Instruments segment. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase\nunder Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations.\nIn accordance with APB Opinion No. 16, the Company allocated the purchase price\nof Vivid based on the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed. Portions of the purchase price, including intangible assets, were\nvalued by independent appraisers utilizing customary valuation procedures and\ntechniques. These intangible assets included approximately $8.1 million for\nacquired in-process research and development (R&D) for projects that had not\nreached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and for which no\nalternative use existed. This allocation represents the estimated fair value\nbased on risk-adjusted cash flows related to the in-process R&D projects; these\ncosts were expensed in the first quarter of 2000. Other acquired intangible\nassets totaling $6.4 million included the fair value of developed technology.\nThese intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful life of\n10 years. Goodwill of $24.1 million resulting from the acquisition of Vivid is\nbeing amortized over 25 years.\n\n     On July 31, 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of NEN Life\nSciences, Inc. (NEN), a provider of state-of-the-art drug discovery products,\nservices, reagents and technologies to the life sciences industry. The Company\npurchased NEN from an investor group led by Genstar Capital LLC for an aggregate\npurchase price of approximately $400 million. In connection with the\nacquisition, the Company paid approximately $350 million in cash and issued\nwarrants to purchase approximately 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock\nin exchange for all of the outstanding shares, options and warrants of NEN. In\naddition, the Company repaid approximately $50 million of outstanding\nindebtedness of NEN. The Company financed the acquisition and repayment of the\noutstanding indebtedness with $410 million of commercial paper borrowings with a\nweighted-average interest rate of 7%. These short-term borrowings were repaid in\nearly August with proceeds from the issuance of long-term convertible debentures\n(see Note 14).\n\n     NEN's operations, included in the consolidated results of the Company from\nthe date of acquisition, are reported in the Life Sciences segment. The\nacquisition was accounted for as a purchase under APB Opinion No. 16, and the\nCompany allocated the purchase price of NEN based on the fair values of the net\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price\nhas not yet been finalized, however, the Company does not expect material\nchanges. Portions of the purchase price, including intangible assets, were\nvalued by independent appraisers utilizing customary valuation procedures and\ntechniques. These intangible assets included approximately $24.3 million for\nacquired in-process research and development (R&D) for projects that had not\nreached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and for which no\nalternative use existed. This allocation represents the estimated fair value\nbased non risk-adjusted cash flows related to the in-process R&D projects; these\ncosts were expensed in the third quarter of 2000. Other acquired intangible\nassets totaling $75.9 million included the fair value of trade names,\ntrademarks, patents and developed technology with lives ranging from 10 - 20\nyears. Goodwill of $270.8 million resulting from the acquisition of NEN is being\namortized over 20 years. Approximately $4 million has been recorded as accrued\nrestructuring costs in connection with the acquisition of NEN. The restructuring\nplans include initiatives to integrate the operations of the Company and NEN,\nand to reduce overhead.

In addition, under the terms\nof the Purchase Agreement dated March 8, 1999 between the Company and PE Corp.\n(the \"Purchase Agreement\"), the Company assumed German and other pension\nliabilities of approximately $65 million. These pension liabilities were\nhistorically funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, and the funding going-forward is\nexpected to remain consistent. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase\nunder APB Opinion No. 16. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 16, the Company\nallocated the purchase price of AI based on the fair values of the net assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed. AI produces high-quality analytical testing\ninstruments and consumables, and generated 1998 fiscal year sales of $569\nmillion. AI's operations are reported in the Company's Instruments segment.\nPortions of the purchase price, including intangible assets, were valued by\nindependent appraisers utilizing customary valuation procedures and techniques.\nThese intangible assets included approximately $23 million for acquired\nin-process R&D. This allocation represents the estimated fair value based on\nrisk-adjusted cash flows related to the in-process R&D projects. At the date of\nthe acquisition of AI, the development of these projects had not yet reached\ntechnological feasibility, and the R&D in process had no alternative future\nuses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed in the second quarter of 1999.\nOther acquired intangibles totaling $163.8 million included the fair value of\ntrade names, trademarks, patents and developed technology. These intangibles are\nbeing amortized over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from 10-40\nyears. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of AI is being amortized over 40\nyears. Approximately $28 million was recorded as accrued restructuring charges\nin connection with the acquisition of AI. The restructuring plans include\ninitiatives to integrate the operations of the Company and of AI, and reduce\noverhead. The primary components of these plans relate to: (a) employee\ntermination benefits and related costs for approximately 20% of the acquired\nworkforce of approximately 3,000 employees; (b) consolidation or shutdown of\ncertain operational facilities worldwide and (c) termination of certain leases\nand other contractual obligations.\n\n     During the second quarter of 2000, the Company finalized its restructuring\nplan for AI. Based on continued aggressive actions by the Company to improve the\ncost structure of the acquired business, and increased costs related primarily\nto employment integration, the Company adjusted its original estimate of\nrestructuring costs recorded at the acquisition date in connection with purchase\naccounting. The majority of the remaining restructuring actions are expected to\noccur through fiscal 2001.\n\n                                        37\n<PAGE>   39\n                       PERKINELMER, INC.

(Lumen), a\nmaker of high-technology specialty light sources. The purchase price of\napproximately $253 million, which included $75 million of assumed debt, was\nfunded with existing cash and commercial paper borrowings. The acquisition was\naccounted for as a purchase under APB Opinion No. 16, and the Company allocated\nthe purchase price of Lumen based on the fair values of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed. Portions of the purchase price, including intangible\nassets, were valued by independent appraisers utilizing proven valuation\nprocedures and techniques. These intangible assets included approximately $2.3\nmillion for acquired in-process R&D for projects that did not have future\nalternative uses. This allocation represents the estimated fair value based on\nrisk-adjusted cash flows related to the in-process R&D projects. At the date of\nthe acquisition, the development of these projects had not yet reached\ntechnological feasibility, and the R&D in process had no alternative future\nuses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of 1998.\nAcquired intangibles totaling $11.8 million included the fair value of trade\nnames, trademarks and patents. These intangibles are being amortized over their\nestimated useful life of 10 years. Goodwill resulting from the Lumen acquisition\nis being amortized over 30 years. Approximately $5 million was recorded as\naccrued restructuring charges in connection with the acquisition. The\nrestructuring plans included initiatives to integrate the operations of the\nCompany and Lumen, and to reduce overhead. The primary components of these plans\nrelated to: (a) transfer of certain manufacturing activities to lower-cost\nfacilities, (b) integration of the sales and marketing organization and (c)\ntermination of certain contractual obligations.\n\n     Unaudited pro forma operating results for the Company, assuming the\nacquisitions of Lumen and AI occurred on December 29, 1997, and NEN occurred on\nJanuary 3, 1999, are as follows:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n       (IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)             2000          1999          1998\n       ------------------------------------          ----------    ----------    ----------\n<S>                                                  <C>           <C>           <C>\nSales from continuing operations...................  $1,765,111    $1,681,817    $1,556,094\nIncome from continuing operations..................      92,981        (3,547)       45,813\n  Basic earnings per share.........................        1.89          (.08)         1.01\n  Diluted earnings per share.......................        1.82          (.08)         1.00\nNet Income.........................................  $   97,434    $  122,398    $   68,814\n  Basic earnings per share.........................        1.98          2.69          1.52\n  Diluted earnings per share.......................        1.91          2.69          1.50\n</TABLE>\n\n                                        38\n<PAGE>   40\n                       PERKINELMER, INC.

The unaudited pro forma financial information is provided for\ninformational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the Company's\noperating results that would have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated\non the date for which the consummation of the acquisitions is being given\neffect, nor is it necessarily indicative of the Company's future operating\nresults. The pro forma amounts do not reflect any operating efficiencies and\ncost savings that the Company believes are achievable. Pro forma amounts for the\nVivid acquisition are not included as its effect is not material to the\nCompany's consolidated financial statements.\n\n     During the first quarter of 2000, the Company sold its micromachined\nsensors and specialty semiconductor businesses for cash of $24.3 million,\nresulting in a pre-tax gain of $6.7 million. Combined financial results of the\ndivested businesses for 2000 and 1999 were not material to the consolidated\nresults of the Company. During the third quarter of 2000, the Company recorded\npre-tax gains totaling $3.1 million from an insurance settlement and disposition\nof a building.\n\n     During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company sold its Berthold business\nat a pre-tax gain of $10 million. The Company has deferred gain recognition of\napproximately $11.9 million of sales proceeds from this divestiture in\nconnection with certain contingencies related to the sale. Revenues for 2000 and\n1999 for the divested business were $30 million and $38 million, respectively.\nAlso during the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of\n$16 million from the sale of a building.\n\n     During the second quarter of 1999, the Company sold its Structural\nKinematics business for cash of $15 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $4.3\nmillion. Additionally, as a result of the Company's continuing evaluation of its\nInstruments businesses, the Company undertook certain repositioning actions\nduring the second quarter of 1999, including exiting selected product lines and\nactivities, rebalancing its customer mix in certain businesses and other related\nactivities. These actions resulted in second quarter pre-tax charges of\napproximately $3.4 million, primarily recorded in cost of sales. During the\nfourth quarter of 1999, the Company sold its KT Aerofab business for cash of\n$4.4 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $0.3 million. The net operating\nresults of the divested businesses for 1999 were not significant.\n\n     In April 1998, the Company sold its Sealol Industrial Seals division for\ncash of $100 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $58.3 million. The\nafter-tax gain of this divestiture was $42.6 million. Sealol's 1998 sales prior\nto the disposition were $23 million, and its operating income was $2.1 million.\nIn January 1998, the Company sold its Rotron division for $103 million in cash,\nresulting in a pre-tax gain of $64.4 million. During the first quarter of 1998,\nthe Company also sold a small product line for $4 million in cash, resulting in\na pre-tax gain of $3.1 million. The after-tax gain of these divestitures was\n$45.2 million in 1998. During 2000 and 1999, in connection with the 1998\ndispositions of the Company's Rotron and Sealol Industrial Seals divisions, the\nCompany recognized approximately $3.7 million and $13.2 million respectively, of\npre-tax gains from the previously deferred sales proceeds as a result of the\nfavorable resolution of certain events and contingencies.\n\n     All of the gains described above are reported on the \"Gains on\nDispositions\" line in the consolidated income statements.\n\nNOTE 3.  RESTRUCTURING AND INTEGRATION CHARGES\n\n     The Company developed restructuring plans during 1998 to integrate and\nconsolidate its businesses and recorded restructuring charges in the first and\nsecond quarters of 1998, which are discussed separately below.\n\n     During the first quarter of 1998, management developed a plan to\nrestructure certain businesses. A discussion of the businesses affected within\neach segment is presented below. The plan resulted in pre-tax restructuring\ncharges totaling $30.5 million. The principal actions in the restructuring plan\nincluded close-down or consolidation of a number of offices and facilities,\ntransfer of assembly activities to lower-cost geographic locations, disposal of\nunderutilized assets, withdrawal from certain product lines and general cost\nreductions.\n                                        39\n<PAGE>   41\n                       PERKINELMER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)\n\n     Specific businesses within each segment which were affected by the\nrestructuring actions are as follows: the Fluid Sciences business affected\nprimarily manufactures mechanical components and systems; the Optoelectronics\nbusinesses affected produce various lighting and sensor components and systems;\nthe Instruments restructuring related primarily to its X-ray imaging business\nwhich produces security screening equipment, as well as its Instruments for\nResearch and Applied Science business which produces particle detector\nequipment.\n\n     During the second quarter of 1998, the Company expanded its continuing\neffort to restructure certain businesses to further improve performance. The\nplan resulted in additional pre-tax restructuring charges of $19.5 million. The\nprincipal actions in this restructuring plan included the integration of\noperating divisions into five strategic business units (SBUs), close-down or\nconsolidation of a number of production facilities and general cost reductions.\nThe Technical Services segment was subsequently sold during the third quarter of\n1999.\n\n     The components of the restructuring charges met the criteria set forth in\nEmerging Issues Task Force Issue 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain\nEmployee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including\nCertain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). The charges do not include\nadditional costs associated with the restructuring plans, such as training,\nconsulting, purchase of equipment and relocation of employees and equipment.\nThese costs were charged to operations or capitalized, as appropriate, when\nincurred.\n\n     During the third quarter of 1999, due to the substantial completion of the\nactions of the 1998 restructuring plans, the Company reevaluated its 1998\nrestructuring plans. As a result of this review, costs associated with the\npreviously planned shutdown of two businesses were no longer required due to\nactions taken to improve performance. As a result of these developments, the\nCompany recognized a restructuring credit of $12 million during the third\nquarter of 1999, which primarily affected the Fluid Sciences and optoelectronics\nsegments.\n\n     During the second quarter of 2000, the Company recognized an additional\nrestructuring credit of $6 million related to its 1998 restructuring plans. This\nresulted from the elimination of certain planned actions, actions taken to\nimprove performance at costs lower than originally estimated, and the sale of\ncertain businesses included in the restructuring plans.\n\n     These credits are reflected in \"Restructuring Charges, Net\" in the\nconsolidated income statements.\n\n     The restructuring charges related to continuing operations recorded in 1998\nwere broken down as follows by operating segment:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                                             TERMINATION OF\n                                                          DISPOSAL OF       LEASES AND OTHER\n                                        EMPLOYEE        CERTAIN PRODUCT       CONTRACTUAL\n(IN MILLIONS)                       SEPARATION COSTS    LINES AND ASSETS      OBLIGATIONS       TOTAL\n-------------                       ----------------    ----------------    ----------------    ------\n<S>                                 <C>                 <C>                 <C>                 <C>\nLife Sciences.....................       $ 3.6               $   .4              $  .6          $  4.6\nOptoelectronics...................         8.5                  6.4                5.4            20.3\nInstruments.......................         6.4                  2.9                2.0            11.3\nFluid Sciences....................         6.2                  1.9                1.8             9.9\nCorporate and Other...............         3.8                   --                 .1             3.9\n                                         -----               ------              -----          ------\nTotal restructuring charges.......        28.5                 11.6                9.9            50.0\nAmounts incurred through January\n  3, 1999.........................

Consistent with the\nstrategic direction of the Company and concurrent with the reevaluation of\nexisting restructuring plans during the third quarter of 1999, the Company\ndeveloped additional plans during the third quarter of 1999 to restructure\ncertain businesses to continue to improve the Company's performance.\n\n     These plans resulted in a pre-tax restructuring charge of $23.5 million\nrecorded in the third quarter of 1999. The principal actions in these\nrestructuring plans include close-down or consolidation of a number of offices\nand facilities, transfer of assembly activities to lower-cost geographic\nlocations, disposal of underutilized assets, withdrawal from certain product\nlines and general cost reductions. The restructuring plans are expected to\nresult in the elimination of approximately 400 positions, primarily in the\nmanufacturing and sales categories. The major components of the restructuring\ncharge were $13.6 million of employee separation costs to restructure the\nworldwide organization, including the sales and manufacturing focus, $2.3\nmillion of noncash charges to dispose of certain product lines and assets\nthrough sale or abandonment and $7.6 million of charges to terminate lease and\nother contractual obligations no longer required as a result of the\nrestructuring plans. The charges do not include additional costs associated with\nthe restructuring plans, such as training, consulting, purchase of equipment and\nrelocation of employees and equipment. These costs will be charged to operations\nor capitalized, as appropriate, when incurred.\n\n     The restructuring actions related to the 1999 charge are broken down as\nfollows by business segment:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                                             TERMINATION OF\n                                                          DISPOSAL OF       LEASES AND OTHER\n                                        EMPLOYEE        CERTAIN PRODUCT       CONTRACTUAL\n(IN MILLIONS)                       SEPARATION COSTS    LINES AND ASSETS      OBLIGATIONS       TOTAL\n-------------                       ----------------    ----------------    ----------------    ------\n<S>                                 <C>                 <C>                 <C>                 <C>\nLife Sciences.....................       $  .5                $ .8               $ 4.9          $  6.2\nOptoelectronics...................         6.1                  .8                 2.1             9.0\nInstruments.......................         1.8                  --                  --             1.8\nFluid Sciences....................         5.2                  .2                  .1             5.5\nCorporate and Other...............          --                  .5                  .5             1.0\n                                         -----                ----               -----          ------\nTotal restructuring charge........        13.6                 2.3                 7.6            23.5\nAmounts incurred through January\n  2, 2000.........................

These costs relate primarily to the Instruments and\nOptoelectronics segments.\n\n     Transfer of assembly activities:  The Company continues to relocate certain\nactivities, primarily in its Optoelectronics segment, to lower-cost geographic\nareas, such as the Philippines, Indonesia and China. The costs included in the\nrestructuring charges related to costs associated with exiting the previous\noperations. Actual costs to physically relocate are charged to operations as\nincurred.\n\n     Disposal of underutilized assets:  The Company plans to dispose of\nunderutilized assets either through sale or abandonment, primarily in its\nInstruments and Optoelectronics segments.\n\n     Withdrawal from certain product lines:  The Company has made a strategic\ndecision to discontinue certain unprofitable product lines, primarily in its\nOptoelectronics segment.\n\n     Most of the actions remaining at December 31, 2000 are expected to occur in\nfiscal 2001.\n\n     During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company reevaluated its 1999\nrestructuring plan due to the substantial completion of the respective actions\nand the continuing transformation of the portfolio of businesses during 2000.\nThis resulted in the reversal of $4.9 million of remaining reserves from the\n1999 plan and the recording of a pre-tax restructuring charge of $15.1 million\nfor actions to be completed in 2001 (the \"2000 plan\"). These charges related to\nthe Company's Life Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. The principal actions\nin the restructuring plans included close-down or consolidation of a number of\noffices and facilities, transfer of assembly activities to lower cost geographic\nlocations, disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions. The\nrestructuring charges were broken down as follows by operating segment: The Life\nSciences' principal actions are associated with rationalization of its\ndistribution network and overall facility consolidation. The Optoelectronics'\nprincipal actions are associated with its Lighting and Imaging businesses and\nrelate to the shift of certain manufacturing to low cost geographic areas,\nfacility consolidation and general cost reductions.\n\n                                        42\n<PAGE>   44\n                       PERKINELMER, INC.

Repatriation of\nretained earnings is done only when it is advantageous. Applicable federal taxes\nare provided only on amounts planned to be remitted. In connection with 1998\ndivestitures, certain proceeds will not be permanently reinvested in those\noperations, and, accordingly, federal taxes in the amount of $10 million were\nprovided in connection with those earnings.\n\nNOTE 7.

The U.S. pension asset was classified as other noncurrent\nassets.\n\n     The Company also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan to\nprovide senior management with benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. At\nDecember 31, 2000 and January 2, 2000, the projected benefit obligations were\n$16.4 million and $14.9 million, respectively. Assets with a fair value of $9.2\nmillion and $9.8 million segregated in a trust, were available to meet this\nobligation as of December 31, 2000 and January 2, 2000, respectively. Pension\nexpense for this plan was approximately $2.0 million in 2000, $1.8 million in\n1999 and $1.4 million in 1998.\n\n     Postretirement Medical Plans:  The Company provides health care benefits\nfor eligible retired U.S. employees under a comprehensive major medical plan or\nunder health maintenance organizations where available. The majority of the\nCompany's U.S. employees become eligible for retiree health benefits if they\nretire directly from the Company and have at least ten years of service.\nGenerally, the major medical plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses\nafter a deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other group\ncoverages and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree contributions under most\ncircumstances and has provisions for cost-sharing changes. For employees\nretiring after 1991, the Company has capped its medical premium contribution\nbased on employees' years of service. The Company funds the amount allowable\nunder a 401(h) provision in the Company's defined benefit pension plan. Assets\nof the plan are comprised primarily of equity and debt securities.\n\n     Net periodic postretirement medical benefit cost (credit) included the\nfollowing components:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n(IN THOUSANDS)                                              2000        1999        1998\n--------------                                            --------    --------    --------\n<S>                                                       <C>         <C>         <C>\nService cost............................................  $    232    $    289    $    360\nInterest cost...........................................       992       1,036       1,250\nExpected return on plan assets..........................

The effect of this decrease on\nthe annual cost for 2000 would have been approximately $37,000.\n\n     Deferred Compensation Plans:  During 1998, the Company implemented certain\nnonqualified deferred compensation programs that provide benefits payable to\nofficers and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at\nspecified future dates, upon retirement or death. Benefit payments under these\nplans are funded by a combination of contributions from participants and the\nCompany.\n\n     Other:  In April 1999, the Company's stockholders approved the 1999\nIncentive Plan, under which cash performance awards as well as an aggregate of\n3.5 million shares of the Company's common stock were made available for option\ngrants, restricted stock awards, performance units and other stock-based awards.\n\nNOTE 17.  REIMBURSEMENT OF INVESTED CAPITAL\n\n     In 1997, the Company received a $30.4 million payment as part of the\nnegotiation of a joint development contract. This payment represented a $27\nmillion reimbursement of previously invested capital, which will be amortized to\nincome over the estimated life of the related assets, and a $3.4 million\nreimbursement of cost of capital, which was included in other income. The\nreimbursement, net of accumulated amortization, included in long-term\nliabilities was $11 million as of December 31, 2000 and $15.3 million as of\nJanuary 2, 2000.\n\nNOTE 18.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\n     The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and\ninvestigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary\ncourse of its business activities. Each of these matters is subject to various\nuncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved\nunfavorably to the Company. The Company has established accruals for matters\nthat are probable and reasonably estimable. Management believes that any\nliability that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters in\nexcess of amounts provided will not have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial position or results of operations of the Company.\n\n     In addition, the Company is conducting a number of environmental\ninvestigations and remedial actions at current and former Company locations and,\nalong with other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (PRP)\nfor certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues\nin the accounting period that the Company's responsibility is established and\nwhen the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $8.8 million\nas of December 31, 2000, representing management's estimate of the total cost of\nultimate disposition of known environmental matters. Such amount is not\ndiscounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or\nindemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of\nvariables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the\nmagnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies,\npossible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which remediation may\noccur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where\nthe Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any\nadditional liability to result from the inability of other significant named\nparties to contribute. The Company expects that such accrued amounts could be\npaid out over a period of up to five years. As assessments and remediation\nactivities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and\nadjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have\nbeen no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a\nmaterial effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nWhile it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts\nrecorded may have been incurred, the preliminary stages of the investigations\nmake it impossible for the Company to reasonably estimate the range of potential\nexposure.\n\n     The Company has received notices from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nasserting deficiencies in federal corporate income taxes for the Company's 1985\nto 1994 tax years. The total additional tax proposed by the IRS amounts to $74\nmillion plus interest. The Company has filed petitions in the United States Tax\nCourt to challenge most of the deficiencies asserted by the IRS. The Company\nbelieves that it has meritorious legal defenses to those\n\n                                        54\n<PAGE>   56\n                       PERKINELMER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)\n\ndeficiencies and believes that the ultimate outcome of the case will not result\nin a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or\nfinancial position.\n\nNOTE 19.  RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\n     For information concerning various investigations, claims, legal\nproceedings, environmental investigations and remedial actions, and notices from\nthe IRS, see Note 18. For information concerning factors affecting future\nperformance, see Management's Discussion and Analysis.\n\n     Costs incurred under cost-reimbursable government contracts, primarily in\nthe former Technical Services segment, which is presented as discontinued\noperations, are subject to audit by the government. The results of prior audits,\ncompleted through 1996, have not had a material effect on the Company.\n\n     The Company's management and operations contracts with the DOE are\npresented as discontinued operations. The Company's last DOE management and\noperations contract expired on September 30, 1997. The Company is in the process\nof negotiating contract closeouts and does not anticipate incurring any material\nloss in excess of previously established reserves.\n\nNOTE 20.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\n     Stock-Based Compensation:  Under the 1999 Incentive Plan, 3.5 million\nadditional shares of the Company's common stock were made available for option\ngrants, restricted stock awards, performance units and other stock-based awards.\nAt December 31, 2000, 1.9 million shares of the Company's common stock were\nreserved for employee benefit plans.\n\n     The Company has nonqualified and incentive stock option plans for officers\nand key employees. Under these plans, options may be granted at prices not less\nthan 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Options expire 7-10\nyears from the date of grant, and options granted become exercisable, in ratable\ninstallments, over periods of 3-5 years from the date of grant. The Compensation\nCommittee of the Board of Directors, at its sole discretion, may also include\nstock appreciation rights in any option granted.

Each right, when\nexercisable, entitles a stockholder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of\na new series of junior participating preferred stock at a price of $60. The\nrights become exercisable only if a person or group acquires 20% or more or\nannounces a tender or exchange offer for 30% or more of the Company's common\nstock. This preferred stock is nonredeemable and will have 1,000 votes per\nshare. The rights are nonvoting, expire in 2005 and may be redeemed prior to\nbecoming exercisable. The Company has reserved 70,000 shares of preferred stock,\ndesignated as Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, for issuance upon\nexercise of such rights. If a person (an Acquiring Person) acquires or obtains\nthe right to acquire 20% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock\n(other than pursuant to certain approved offers), each right (other than rights\nheld by the Acquiring Person) will entitle the holder to purchase shares of\ncommon stock of the Company at one-half of the current market price at the date\nof occurrence of the event. In addition, in the event that the Company is\ninvolved in a merger or other business combination in which it is not the\nsurviving corporation or in connection with which the Company's common stock is\nchanged or converted, or it sells or transfers 50% or more of its assets or\nearning power to another person, each right that has not previously been\nexercised will entitle its holder to purchase shares of common stock of such\nother person at one-half of the current market price of such common stock at the\ndate of the occurrence of the event.\n\n     Comprehensive Income:  The components of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) were as follows:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                           FOREIGN CURRENCY                        ACCUMULATED OTHER\n                                             TRANSLATION       UNREALIZED GAINS      COMPREHENSIVE\n(IN THOUSANDS)                               ADJUSTMENTS        ON SECURITIES        INCOME (LOSS)\n--------------                             ----------------    ----------------    -----------------\n<S>                                        <C>                 <C>                 <C>\nBalance, December 28, 1997...............      $ (4,380)            $ 523              $ (3,857)\nCurrent year change......................         7,723              (137)                7,586\n                                               --------             -----              --------\nBalance, January 3, 1999.................         3,343               386                 3,729\nCurrent year change......................

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to\nconcentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments\nand accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant\nconcentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2000.\n\n     In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign\nexchange forward contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures\nto mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated\nin foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include\nintercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are\nprimarily in European and Asian currencies, generally have maturities that do\nnot exceed one month and have no cash requirements until maturity. Credit risk\nand market risk are minimal because the forward contracts are with very large\nbanks, and gains and losses are offset against foreign exchange gains and losses\non the underlying hedged transactions. Realized gains and losses on foreign\ncurrency instruments, which are hedges of committed transactions on assets and\nliabilities, are recognized at the time the underlying transaction is completed.\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses on forward contracts, which are not\nhedges of committed transactions, are recognized in income. The notional amount\nof outstanding forward contracts was approximately $190 million as of December\n31, 2000 and $75 million at January 2, 2000.

These financial statements are the\nresponsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\n\n     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally\naccepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements\nare free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,\nevidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An\naudit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial\nstatement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinion.\n\n     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PerkinElmer,\nInc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and January 2, 2000, and the\nresults of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December\n31, 2000, January 2, 2000 and January 3, 1999 in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States.\n\n/s/ ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP\n---------------------------------------------------------\nBoston, Massachusetts\nJanuary 25, 2001\n\n                                        63\n<PAGE>   65\n\nITEM 9.
